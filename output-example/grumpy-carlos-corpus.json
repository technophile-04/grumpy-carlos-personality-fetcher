I prefer to add stuff later on (than removing, which is usually harder)\r\n\r\n> Do we need logo?\r\n\r\nI don't think so. Same as v1.\r\n\r\n> Will we show every home/portfolio etc buttons on the header or make it as on current sre? (portfolio only)\r\n\r\nI think it has some logic depending on your role. For now you can only show \"portfolio\" when you are logged in an register.\r\n\r\n> As I understand we don't need balance and network, right?\r\n> Hide \"view on block explorer\" button?\r\n> Do we need Eth price at the bottom?\r\n\r\nRemove all!",

I don't thing we are using that anywhere in the code, so removing it. We'd use it in the future. (e.g. unlock profile)\r\n- Uncomment \"createBGMember\". Yes, It's pointing at production but it's not a big deal. I prefer it that way so @Pabl0cks  / @technophile-04  can test with a real env. (I can always delete the test users later)\r\n- Fix \"Build Guidl\" copy to \"BuidlGuidl\" in all ocurrences\r\n\r\nPS. Future: loved how you had the autograder / bg 3.5 locally for testing this. I think we could have some kind of mock or easier way to test.",

      "body": "Thanks for the explanation Shiv!\r\n\r\n\r\nI think this PR is too big, not only number of lines wise (which is not super big) but also functionality wise. It's changing the lib for the Database, adding the location functionality, and creating a new system for importing data from BG. This should probably be 3 PRs. Merging something like this is more likely to break production (and harder to review)\r\n\r\nI think it could be:\r\n1. Database changes\r\n2. Location functionality.\r\n3. Import\r\n\r\n(This is what I tried to do with batches)\r\n\r\n- I had the scripts in the services/database folder... seems to make more sense? We will have a bunch of import scripts from BG.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a0cb73e-699f-4a03-b901-3bc51402f24b)\r\n\r\nWe can discuss in the PR/issue tho!\r\n\r\n- I see that you are tweaking package.json to add the script. I think running it with `yarn tsx` should be enough, no? Maybe the issues I was having on https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/SpeedRunEthereum-v2/pull/127#issuecomment-2809234145 was because of it haha (database wasn't avaiable):\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks !!

So returning `null` in those cases.\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76e8d689-e42a-4e6f-95fc-887a2481bd43)\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72cb7f30-ab69-4997-8d45-72b9fa2f1279)\r\n\r\n2. https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/SpeedRunEthereum-v2/pull/127/commits/65b75dd07f278f628497cc01d5e781816dc66006\r\n\r\nChanged the UX/UI a bit on the buttons\r\n- I think CTA/Action should always be on the right, so switched the reset / update buttons\r\n- Reset, just unselects the country (doesn't send the actual call, you need to click update location). For me, this is more natural, but let  me know what you think.\r\n- reset => btn ghost to make it \"less competitve\"\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5018ced9-39b5-42a6-a33f-6080eacbafbe)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1ca6c4a-0efd-4430-a239-1d40751d4af8)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n> Also created a branch in neon db with named location from main. And configured that URL to be used by vercel preview deployment and ran yarn drizzle-kit migrate on this location branch in db.\r\n\r\nGreat stuff. I think when we merge, we should do a clean up (delete database branch + Vercel env var). Maybe this will be automated in the future.\r\n\r\n> https://speedrunethereum-v2-m2vd97nao-buidlguidldao.vercel.app/\r\n\r\nFor preview branches, Vercel gives you two URL:\r\n1. The one you pasted (specific to a given commit / deployment)\r\n2. The general URL for the branch [speedrunethereum-v2-git-issue-97-buidlguidldao.vercel.app](https://speedrunethereum-v2-git-issue-97-buidlguidldao.vercel.app/)\r\n\r\nJust mentioning in case people are trying to access to commit deployment URL and doesn't see it updated with the new commits.\r\n\r\n> We need to run yarn drizzle-kit migrate for staging and main branch of neon DB \r\n\r\nYes!\r\n\r\nNote: for staging, you can also \"reset from parent\" in the Neon UI after you run the migrations on Main.\r\n\r\nApproving this! If you agree with my changes, let's merge (and run the migrations), if not, let's discuss!\r\n\r\nThanks Shiv, great job!\r\n",

Even if you use HTTP, you can refetch the data (Which we are doing) or do a page hard refresh (new HTTP connection) and the thing should show.\r\n\r\nSo there might be a layer of caching that I'm not aware of.\r\n",

Checkout https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/SpeedRunEthereum-v2/pull/133#issuecomment-2817742571 for more info 🙌\r\n\r\nThis made me think: we probably want batch operations for all our import scripts, right? Seems to be the safer (all or nothing import) and efficient way (many statements for tx)\r\n\r\n=> To make that happen, we need `drizzle-orm/neon-http`\r\n\r\nSo there are two options:\r\n1. Instantiate the DB on each import script using `neon-http`.\r\n  - CONS: Repeating code (instantiating database) + we can't use repositories. Not a big deal I think.\r\n2. Tweak PosgresClient to use `neon-http` in some case (detect if script / nextjs enviroments or env var or whatever)\r\n  - CONS: Making it more complex\r\n\r\nIf we go with 1, I guess this PR won't make sense.\r\n\r\nA quick and dirty example of 2:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n// Use something like this to detect if script?\r\nconst isScript = !!process.argv[1]?.includes(\"scripts/\");\r\nconst isScript = !process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nif (process.env.POSTGRES_URL?.includes(NEON_DB_STRING)) {\r\n    if (isScript) {\r\n    // Instanciate using neon-http\r\n    } else {\r\n    const neonPool = new NeonPool({ connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_URL as string });\r\n    dbInstance = drizzleNeon(neonPool, { schema, casing: \"snake_case\" });\r\n   } \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

If we import and then rollback, or if we add a batch and then remove it.... the database keeps an internal number of the autoincremental id `*`, so we could end up with numbers starting from a number != 0 and skipping. I just used a serial (instead of randon uuid) because we used serial in another table (but we should treat it as one. If it's confusing, we can change it)\r\n\r\n`*` it's possible to restart that number, but in any case, we shouldn't use that ID\r\n\r\nEven if we make sure it's always start from 0 and we don't skip any number.....something that would still happen: We create a \"Stanford University Batch\" (it gets assigned id = 16), and then we create \"Batch 16\" (id = 17)\r\n\r\nSo, options:\r\n1. Add the github / website as fields (as you suggested to me last week)\r\n2. We add an extra field (internalNumbering) for our typical internal batches.\r\n3. We use the display name as the generator. e.g. \"Batch 16\" => lowercase / no space => batch16.buidlguidl.com\r\n\r\n3 is a bit hacky, yes haha We could have a dynamic text below the admin form (Batch Name field) that shows the result live:\r\n\r\ninput: Bat => shows below: bat.buidlguidl.com\r\ninput: Batch 16 => shows below: batch16.buidlguidl.com\r\ninput: Standford Batch => shows below: standfordbatch.buidlguidl.com\r\n\r\nBut 1 & 2 make sense too.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks for the write-up Shiv, really helpful. I've been playing with it a bit.\r\n\r\n> I think we should remove the pg library and use only @neondatabse/serverless for drivers since its drop-in replacement.\r\n\r\nI think \"drop-in\" replacement means that it uses the same API as PG. So if you were using PG before to connect to Neon, you can just change it, and it works.\r\n\r\nBut for our local setup, it's not the case (We are using a classic PG database, tcp)... so it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI tried to use neon for it (neon, neonPool, neon-http) and all of them were giving errors while trying to run a simple import script (without transaction / batches).\r\n\r\nErrors were:\r\n- `fetch failed` HTTP doesn't work \r\n- `All attempts to open a WebSocket to connect to the database failed.` Websockets don't work\r\n\r\nSo what you were mentioning here:\r\n> Since neondatabse has this extra feture of http, while configuring local databse instead of using normal postgreas docker, we should their neon-proxy local db setup which gives this methods as well as is more closer to prod neon databse.\r\n\r\nIt's not just an optional upgrade, we need to do it if we want to get rid of node-postgres.\r\n\r\nI went ahead and updated the docker-compose with theirs (and it worked fine with the PG driver too). Tried to update the `postgresClient` as they suggest in https://neon.tech/guides/local-development-with-neon#connect-your-app and didn't manage to make it work (\"connection refused\" probably some config issue that we could figure out)\r\n\r\nBut in any case, it's super ugly... so if removing PG made us add all of this (+ we need the ws dep if we want to use websocket), it might not be worth it. eg:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {\r\n  connectionString = 'postgres://postgres:postgres@db.localtest.me:5432/main';\r\n  neonConfig.fetchEndpoint = (host) => {\r\n    const [protocol, port] = host === 'db.localtest.me' ? ['http', 4444] : ['https', 443];\r\n    return `${protocol}://${host}:${port}/sql`;\r\n  };\r\n  const connectionStringUrl = new URL(connectionString);\r\n  neonConfig.useSecureWebSocket = connectionStringUrl.hostname !== 'db.localtest.me';\r\n  neonConfig.wsProxy = (host) => (host === 'db.localtest.me' ? `${host}:4444/v2` : `${host}/v2`);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPushed non-working changes here: https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/SpeedRunEthereum-v2/tree/123-import-batches-script__neon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo not sure, having this PR as it is might make more sense.... since it works nicely for both Next runtime + scripts runtime.\r\n\r\nIn any case, since we kind of know all the theory, feel free to tinker and see if you can come up with a clean code solution.\r\n\r\nWe can also merge this and continue the discussion (if it make sense to continue it lol) in another issue",

This works but not sure if it's the best approach (since having \"\" value default the purpose of notNull columns)\r\n\r\nThe error makes a lot of sense, since we are adding a notNull field. If we `migrate` and it fails, it indicates **that there is some data that needs to be updated**. Maybe when this happens in the future, we need to attach a script (or even tweak the generated SQL in some case) to update the existing data.\r\n\r\nIn this case, I think it's complety fine, since in `main` the batch data will be empty.

      "body": "We are being a bit nitpicky with the DB stuff (but because it's fun, and we want to learn more haha), so don't worry too much. But let me try to answer some questions\r\n\r\n> Why rollbacks are painful? Aren't they work automatically? Well, I've asked AI and read about locking tables and hence other queries, additional i/o operation to revert and some more reasons . Just want to understand what is the main issue in our case\r\n\r\nImagine you want to import 100k rows (user data) into the database. If you use a `transaction` without chunks, if the row 99.999 fails (e.g. invalid data), the \"automatic\" rollback will happen... and if we are doing this in a production database, it can kill it / make it super slow (people using the platform will be affected)\r\n\r\nThat's why I asked: does it make sense to use tx here? We don't really need to rollback in this case (if a user fails to import, we can check what was the error... and reimport/fix that user only... no need to revert back the others). This is still hardcore (100k requests!)\r\n\r\nThat's why, for this particular use case... `batch` is the way to go (a single TX with all the data). You can also split into chunks, but since we only have ~1k users, no need.\r\n\r\nNote: Transactions make sense when you want \"all or nothing\".... e.g. if one query fails it will leave the DB in a incoherent state\r\n\r\n> Notifications system of failing queries\r\n\r\nI haven't thought about this, but it's important. What happens if 1 query fail? Do we get a clear message in the response?\r\n\r\ncc @technophile-04 \r\n\r\n> As I understand main reason to use batches is when performance matters. But in our case it's just one-time operations, do we need to care about it? Or maybe using transactions has some cost?\r\n\r\nAnd yes, you are right about this. We are just geeking around :nerd_face: \r\n\r\n",

But it's the way to go when you have `N:N` relations.\r\n- `1:1` (just include the data in a single  table. e.g.  builder + socialGithub => builder table)\r\n- `1:N` (create 2 tables referencing each other from N to 1: e.g. builder + challenge => builder + userChallenges tables)\r\n- `N:N` (create 3 tables: the extra table holds the multiple references to the other two + you can add \"metadata\". e.g builder + build => builder + build + buildBuilder tables)",

A bit edge case probably.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a nitpick! The data should always be fresh in this case. I think Next 14 caches hard by default (I think they changed it on Next 15). Do we need to add `force-dynamic` to the API route? I think @technophile-04 has more fresh info in his mind. https://nextjs.org/docs/14/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#opting-out-of-data-caching\r\n\r\n> removed socials requirement as it was when joining bg since user joining tg channel. Or do we need it?\r\n\r\nNot for now, all good.\r\n\r\n> Currently I'm adding users to latest open batch if it exists. But as I understand in the future there could be parallel multiple batches (universities etc). If I'm right, behavior should be changed, for example add flag for an open batch where to add users.\r\n\r\nYeah, future problems maybe :D\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI think this is almost ready to go.

      "body": "Hey Rinat, thanks for all of this... super easy to see options now :)\r\n\r\nSome context: In Prague, we talked a lot about the builder's portfolio in SRE. It'll be the central piece of SRE, and we plan on updating a lot (show challenges in a different way, side quest, poap / nfts, etc). So \"Getting an ENS\" is another quest that builders could take on.\r\n\r\nI imagine something like:\r\n- A builder join SRE\r\n- Complete a few challenges\r\n- Goes to their profile and see options for next steps \r\n- One of the options / side quest: (?) icon next to their address. Hover or modal click => \"Hey, it seems that you don't have a ENS...blababla... check this SRE guide about ENS.....blabla\"\r\n- They get one\r\n- Go back to their profile, and they can hit a ♻️ icon to update it.\r\n- Now the ens name shows in their profile\r\n- We could do the same for ENS Avatar!\r\n\r\n(this is just the general vision for the future)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnyway, just wanted to give some context. What I think is the best approach is and we can tackle in this PR for a first iteration:\r\n\r\n- `ens` field on user table (already in this PR) :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- When an user registers, check if they have ENS and store it (already in this PR) :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- ENS refresh button (as in #180). But I think we can merge this later on, so we can discuss it a bit more on how to display it, etc. :clock1: \r\n- No cron job (remove from this PR) ❌\r\n- Create a script to fetch and store all the ENS for existing users, so we can run it when we merge this PR (ToDo: Let's explore if there are options to fetch multiple addresses at the same time...) :heavy_plus_sign: \r\n\r\nI think this is the simplest and minimal approach, and it serves our purpose of side quests.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

Well, it's one by one but some amount in parallel in every batch\r\n\r\nMaking 12k request in a short period of time might be problematic haha. It's only once... so not sure. In any case, I was refering to multicall options (1 RPC call for a bunch of addresses).

This is looking pretty good.\r\n\r\nI haven't reviewed deeply, but commenting on a few things:\r\n\r\n- Let's sort them by likes DESC (check `build_likes` table) \r\n- Show the likes on the card  + allow like/unlike (I think you can copy from the builds cards inside builders portolio page)\r\n- Align the view button at the bottom of the card\r\n\r\n> I had made a previous version that fetched the data on the server side, but the text search wasn't ideal.\r\n> This is the client side version and it seems more aligned with the other pages that have text filtering.\r\n\r\nI think we have a good balance in the /builders page. What I'd do here:\r\n\r\nLet's fetch only the first 30/50 from the backend (or maybe 32... 48 or any multiple of 4, since you are showing 4 per row) items\r\n  - This will make us move the text search to the backend again. Agree that text search is amazing when searching in memory/client, but we already have +1k builds, and if it keeps growing it might get clunky.\r\n  - Could we do the infinite scroll thing here too?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, feel free to leave some items for future PRs.

Let me give you a bit more context, so it can help in future PRs too\r\n\r\nIn SRE, we merge a bunch of PRs every week. The SRE codebase changes and grows constantly. If we want to keep it maintainable (reduce weird bugs, easy to add stuff, easy for people to work with) we need to keep the codebase clean and simple. If we allow each PR to have a little bit of \"noise\", we would end up with a mess in a few months.\r\n\r\nFor me, a good \"landing page visual tweaks\" PR, would have been a PR that tweaks some little things (spacing, sizes, colors, etc). Instead, it's a PR that added 4 files, modified another 4, and uses some vibe-coded raw JS to interact with the DOM. Plus, some of the functionality (parallax) doesn't work properly outside of macOS.\r\n\r\nSo these are the main reasons this PR hasn't been merged, and I pushed back on it. Just me protecting the codebase, nothing personal haha!\r\n\r\nAlso: If something is more than \"tweaks\" it's always good to open an issue / discuss on TG before tackling a PR.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you want to have closure with the PR, you can remove some of the changes (parallax, etc) and focus on some style tweaks that bug you... so we merge this PR.\r\n\r\nThen, we can focus on more high-leverage things, and go back to tweaks when that's done (and we can have a bigger discussion on how to implement some of the animations\r\n\r\nThanks, Andrea! hmu if you have any questions",

And maybe we add a TG button in the page\r\nSo we're still inside SRE while reading more about the challenge.. not sure if the TG channel helps so early on, Just thinking out loud\r\n\r\nYes, going directly to TG doesn't help. But going to GitHub might make sense (as we are doing in the build idea on the portfolio page). Internal page also makes sense! \r\n\r\nChallenges / build ideas are currently too tied... at some point we might want to separate the entities (in database or something). At that point we can decide what to do.\r\n\r\nThanks all, good stuff!! Merged!",

      "body": "Hey Pablo, thanks for putting this together. After our conversations, I did a big refactor of the sidequest feature. Let me give some context, so @rin-st can also review.\r\n\r\nYou version was _simple_ in a sense that it was in a single file, but it was hiding a lot of complexity and had a lot of coupling.\r\n\r\nI decided to do an architectural refactor (without getting too crazy). My main goal was to make it clear, simple, and maintainable (if we add / remove sidequests). Main pieces:\r\n\r\n- `sideQuests/schema.ts`: The source of truth for the sidequest config (since we are not using the database to save the config, as in challenges). `SIDEQUESTS` will contain all the data that we need (e.g. link to a guide).\r\n- `sideQuests/checks.ts`: It holds the check function for each side quest.\r\n- `sideQuests/index.ts`: Export the main function to be used `fetchSideQuestsSnapshot`. Takes a `user` as a parameter. Changes from your approach:\r\n  - Only saves completed sidequest to the database. I think `pending` state was a bit confusing, and we were adding a lot of unnecessary data. I think this is enough for the UI too.\r\n  - Skip completed side quest (not sure if you had this)\r\n  - Removed the `sidequest` object \"prefix\" in the new database field (`sidequests: {data}` => `{data}`)\r\n- `sideQuests/types.ts`: just needed types.\r\n\r\n- `onchainData/zerion.ts`: wraps Zerion API calls. (Also added some throws and console.errors)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n- Added Zerion API KEY env var to Vercel (remove the base64 codification in the code, and just using the encoded version in the env var, as it was in the docs)\r\n- You can create this page if you don't want to test by registering all the time:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// app/sidequest/page.tsx\r\nimport { getUserByAddress } from \"~~/services/database/repositories/users\";\r\nimport { fetchSideQuestsSnapshot } from \"~~/services/sideQuests\";\r\n\r\nexport default async function SideQuestsPage() {\r\n  // TODO: Replace with the user you like that exist in the database.\r\n  const user = await getUserByAddress(\"0xB4F53bd85c00EF22946d24Ae26BC38Ac64F5E7B1\");\r\n  if (!user) {\r\n    throw new Error(\"User not found\");\r\n  }\r\n  const sideQuests = await fetchSideQuestsSnapshot(user);\r\n  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(sideQuests, null, 2)}</pre>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

Using string (even if typed) looked a bit weird to me. Not sure if there is a better way (without repeating the `id` in the `SIDEQUEST` object). Does it make sense to you? \r\n\r\n(also pushed some little copy changes in there)\r\n\r\nAlso, a couple of things I think we should add to this PR:\r\n\r\n- ENS Avatar side quest. It should be easy to add.\r\n- Use sidequests for XP points calculation. What about adding 5 points per sidequest completed?\r\n\r\nMaybe we should fix and merge #307 first?\r\n",

(I think we touched on this in #303). \r\n\r\nSomething to keep in mind for the next PRs: When a PR is already approved and ready to merge (in this case, waiting for some _content_ feedback) it's just better to merge and create another PR (even if it's small) to add new stuff. If not, we add extra cycles to the PR and delay shipping. \r\n\r\nIn this case, I went ahead and did the changes myself (to avoid another extra round: feedback by me + tweaks by you + review by me)\r\n\r\nCode changes:\r\n- Moved `splitChallengeReadme` to a service (GitHub makes sense, though it could also fit under the Challenge util).\r\n- Refactor `splitChallengeReadme` to make it simpler. Regex are complex enough haha. Just checking that we have a H1 + img. Some of the more defensive edge cases you added felt less important, and better to have a clear \"spec\" for README structure. \r\n\r\nThese are not a big deal, but we always try to keep code as clean, simple, and readable as possible. Otherwise, little things add up, and after 25+ PRs, the codebase becomes harder to read and maintain :D\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Super helpful.\r\n\r\nRegarding the **rounding error**: I explored your suggestions and ended up with: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-ui/pull/11/commits/c112f2812301c34f0aa52f75ed37155771e73236.\r\n\r\nIt's basically separating the display mode (what currency the UI shows) from the source mode (what currency the typed value represents). Now, toggling only flips the display without mutating the original typed value (eliminating the floating error). The component preserves the user's exact input until they actually start typing in the opposite currency mode (where we switch the source currency to match what they're now editing). \r\n\r\nIt's making the component \"smarter\" and leaving the hook as it is (removing the activeValue).\r\n\r\nWdyt?\r\n\r\n> What do you think guys about keeping InputBase in components and building EtherInput/AddressInput/maybe more on top of it the same way as it was before, so our inputs will have the same styles? It could be internal component without import\r\n\r\nYes! I think this is good idea. I might copy it from your PR.\r\n\r\n> Not sure though if we should have two components ( internal controlled / uncontrolled).\r\n\r\noh no! Agree. My plan was just to create it in the PR so we can compare and test... but once we decide, let's remove the one we don't like.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the decision is between: internally controlled (current PR, controlled inside the component) VS externally controlled (controlled by the user of the component). I don't think we want to do _uncontrolled_ (but happy to test if you think it's worth it!)\r\n\r\nI guess what we decide should be applied to #12 too?\r\n\r\n> useEtherInput has nothing about input. Probably we could name hooks differently. For example if name it like useEthUsdConvertation, it can be used not only in inputs\r\n\r\nAlso thought about this when creating it. Agree that's not the best naming... but in the other hand, having a the correlation between component / hook can make sense? I'm 50/50 on it :D\r\n\r\nrelated: do we need `useAddressInput` hook? Or could we just have `useAddress` hook and then `Address` and `AddressInput` components using that hook?\r\n\r\nSorry, opening a lot of threads in the discussion haha\r\n\r\nBut thank you, this is super enriching 👾",

I've never used that patter before for this, but make sense?\r\n\r\n**internall vs externally controlled**\r\n\r\nI've been tinkering and I haven't come to a solution that I like. To make it externally controlled, you still need to pass back the converted value to the user of the component, so you have a bunch of \"onChangeFunction\" (value, mode, conversion). \r\n\r\nSo my current take is (as Shiv mentioned in his comment too): Have it internally controlled (super easy to use, just a drop-in component / widget). If you want full control, you have the hook!\r\n\r\nBut I might be missing something! \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm gonna add some props (like defaultValue as Rinat suggested) to make it more functional.\r\n\r\nAlso will add the InputBase from Rinat.",

I wasn't sure whether to post the comment here or on https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-ui/issues/22.\r\n\r\nFirst, this is a nice approach, and it solves a lot of use cases.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"837\" height=\"307\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f2bb440-b367-433b-887c-e68160524270\" />\r\n\r\nThis is not beautiful, but it gets the job done haha\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nMy only _concern_ is if we are going too far. As we talked a few weeks ago, we have the components and the hooks. With hooks, you can do whatever you want (jsx / style wise), and components will give you some defaults that work out of the box.\r\n\r\nThis, from Shiv (on #22)...\r\n\r\n> There are 3 problems we need to solve for better DX:\r\n> 1. Allowing people to somehow pass a global object so that they don't need to pass the same color to each component they use\r\n> 2. Handling dark mode nicely\r\n> 3. Specific component color override. (Like they only want AddressInput to look different but EtherInput and other components should look the same)\r\n\r\n... might be going too far. If we implement these, as this PR does, we are basically solving \"everything\". It feels like we are just one step away from not needing the hooks (just JSX/layout tweaks)\r\n\r\n**These are just raw thoughts, opening them for discussion.**\r\n\r\nLet me try to think about a few options from out-of-the-box solutions (less customization) to max customization (this PR)\r\n\r\n1. **Having predefined themes**. It could just be light / dark.... or a 2/3 color palette for each mode.\r\n2. **Root customization with CSS vars**. Same as 1 (just light / dark themes) + allow overriding those with CSS vars (Rainbowkit does this?)\r\n3. **\"Total\" Control**. This PR. I think it's 2 + allow customization per component.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTLDR: This approach definitely solves our needs. Just let's make sure we are not overengineering things.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you all think!! Happy to have a call for this next week, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Or you mean by directly copypasting component code?\r\n\r\nI was talking about headless components / Compound components / etc. Approaches that let you control the layout of the exported component from the lib (the only thing missing from not needing hooks at all)\r\n\r\n> Will @source inline(\"bg-sui-primary ...) will remain constant or we have to keep updating it? (just thinking will it be PITA for us like everytime we update the theme we need to update the sources)\r\n\r\nWe are also increasing the CSS for the user (all the classes will always be present, whether they use it or not). Maybe it's ok if these classes are not going to change a lot and there are just a few of them.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Do we really want to export all the utility classes to the user?? It seems that the users will be using just the CSS tokens to override things, and you said:\r\n\r\n> I think it's not the case since the app could have totally **different colors** and every our palette could be bad\r\n\r\nSo people will use our default colors.... or override them with their own colors (with CSS tokens), so I don't think they will use things `bg-sui-primary` in their code\r\n\r\nSo I'd go with 1 from your options, Rinat.",

Yes, it fixes the hydration issue, but your completely remove the [pre-rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering) capabilities that NextJS has.\r\n\r\nYou can check the pre-rendering by disabling the JS in your browser and you'll see that with your fix, it renders a page black (no pre-rendering at all).",

(Demo attached below)\r\n\r\n> Should we create a New issue for this? or try fixing it in this PR only? Like I tried finding a solution but didn't get anything useful.\r\n\r\nYep, we'll need to find a way to trigger that balance refresh with rainbow kit.

We could also refactor our slices:\r\n\r\nFrom\r\n```ts\r\nexport const useAppStore = create<TAppStore>()((...set) => ({\r\n  tempSlice: createTempSlice(...set),\r\n  ethPriceSlice: createEthPriceSlice(...set),\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo\r\n```ts\r\nexport const useAppStore = create<TAppStore>()((...set) => ({\r\n  ...createTempSlice(...set),\r\n  ...createEthPriceSlice(...set),\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, everything would be at the same level and we could take advantage of the merging.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  setEthPrice: (newValue: number): void => set((state): TAppStore => ({ ethPrice: newValue })),\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr maybe I'm missing something...

I added a enable/disable flag for the polling.\r\n\r\n**Use asyn/await.**  \r\nAs a convention, we use async/await in the project (VS .then())\r\n\r\n**Return price = 0 on error. Explicit TS type on return functions**\r\nI think it's better if the util always return a number. Now it returns 0 when error (hope this is never the real value of ETH 😂)\r\n\r\n@technophile-04 Can you review & test these changes? ",

Looking great!!\r\n\r\nLeft a few review comments.\r\n\r\nAnswering to your suggestions:\r\n\r\n> I have used daisy UI's [Collapse component](https://daisyui.com/components/collapse/) to show the read and write contract's function. Seems like daisy UI does this by using CSS only because of which in future if we need open/close state then it will be somewhat difficult to get. Please let me know if I should implement the collapsable manually with react state, happy to refactor the code :)\r\neg: Where we might need open/close state is changing the DownArrow icons besides read and write buttons :\r\n\r\nIt seems that Daisy has the `collapse-arrow` class. Could you try that? https://daisyui.com/components/collapse/#with-arrow-icon\r\n\r\nBTW, **Can you make the content visible by default?** https://daisyui.com/components/collapse/#force-open\r\n\r\n> If you look at Address input in the above video it doesn't seem to fit well since we are using the AddressInput component there.\r\n\r\nRn the AddressInput is not used anywhere else. So what if we tweak it as we need... and we can think about generalizing it OR abstract it in the future? let's see how that looks like!\r\n\r\n> While Implementing the design I found repeating the same class names for different div's, is it ok if [extract these classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply) and put them inside globas.css ?\r\n\r\nThis is tricky! I'd say: If it's a group of classes that we are going to use in different component / pages, then @apply sounds good. But if it's for divs in the same component, I don't think it makes sense (for now at least!). We can always refactor later on.\r\n\r\n> Feel free to point out bad coding practices and stuff that can be done better...happy to refactor it again!\r\n\r\nEverything looks clean and minimal ;)\r\n\r\nThanks Shiv!\r\n",

Don't you all think is bad DX? Not sure if there is another option: Maybe `import { Address } from \"abitype\";` as they do in wagmi... and use that type instead of `string`. Not sure of the implications yet, but would love to hear your thoughts! \r\n\r\nThanks!!",

Always love your deep researches :) \r\n\r\n> Don't know why for me adding abitype to devDependency of nextjs directory is not working that's why added it directly to monorepo (Even I feel we shouldn't add such thing to monorepos's dependency, would love if someone could give this a try might be some problem with my vsCode)\r\n\r\nFor me (I use Intellij) it works without adding `abitype` as a **devDependency** anywhere (I deleted all the node_modules folders && yarn install). The global.d.ts does the trick for me.\r\n\r\nI created https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/107 to check types. To test, I merged it in this branch (in my machine) and ran `yarn next:check-types`.. and it worked! (Except for your point 3).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486142/214140695-46fe8792-8937-4e56-bdf6-a4f56f86f417.png)\r\n\r\nIf I remove the `global.d.ts` file, it gives me:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486142/214140783-15fea45d-a662-43fa-9a9c-5075bb541c1d.png)\r\n\r\nSo it seems that it works fine with just having the `global.d.ts` declaration. Maybe it's something going on with your IDE?\r\n\r\n> used disable-next-line no-unused-vars for global.d.ts, I think there is some problem with eslint : checkout https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/2287\r\n\r\nNot our fault so not a big deal, let's keep the disabled-next-line there.\r\n\r\n> IMP: if you pull the changes and go to BurnerConnector.ts you will find some typescript errors because in some places AdressType still refers to 0x{string} even after adding the declaration file.\r\n\r\nThis is a weird one :/ \r\n\r\nI'd say: spend a little more time with it if you want.... and if we can't find a solution, lets `// @ts-ignore` it, writing a bit of explanation.\r\n\r\n",

Pushed https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/109/commits/b9af9b82b89c663a74ad4df6c17224817bf4c095 to remove the magic number (-50px): It's just a nitpick haha But it's a magic number since it depends on the size of the tooltip content.

I saw this (didn't check how they implemented it): https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fast-marquee\r\nMaybe we can get some inspiration from it... or even use the lib (Not sure if I can live with the extra 27 Kb haha)\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you don't see a good solution for now..... let's leave it as it's.

Also Vercel support all NextJS capabilities (not like surge). So let's roll with it!\r\n\r\n> if you go to https://test-deploy-iota.vercel.app/debug you see NO contract found and you need to connect your wallet particularly to goerli to see the contract and even interact with it. This issue seems like an beta-launch issue I think the reason might be using of useNetwork and useProvider which depends on connected wallet rpc i might be wrong but looking into this\r\n\r\nYep! I saw you created an issue/PR. I'll comment there. Thanks\r\n\r\n> I think we should keep it true here (NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS)\r\n[se-2/packages/nextjs/.env.production](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/blob/5a715b28e6bf3c82500a03384154f76ef9ced2ed/packages/nextjs/.env.production#L2)\r\n\r\nI changed it for now. I think we should take another approach for this, since the network switcher is not something that most people use (you usually deploy your dApp to work on a single network): hardhat when developing + goerli/mainnet on prod. Maybe instead of NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS we can have a NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NETWORK_SWITCH (defaults fo false). Anyway, I'll think more about this and will create an issue for it.\r\n\r\nI also added some (v0.1) documentation to the README.\r\n",

Which is super handy! But _I think_ we also want to be able to retrieve past events. e.g. we want to list all the token transfers.\r\n\r\nSE1 does it. But I think wagmi doesn't have a hook for it. Maybe it's too heavy and people are supposed to use another approach for it (like subgraphs)?\r\n\r\nIn any case, we can discuss on the existing issue and merge this.\r\n\r\nMaybe change the hook name to `useScaffoldEventSubscriber` or similar?\r\n\r\nThoughts? Thanks!!\r\n\r\n",

Too many notifications on load :D\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486142/219608631-c7b49b4f-b42f-41f9-9849-527b724d0ea1.png). Not sure if this should be handled on the caller, or directly on the notification util (saving a list of currently showed notifications, and don't show if a notification with the same content is there?)\r\n\r\n2. If `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` is a invalid network, it defaults to hardhat (because of `getTargetNetwork`). I get the same \"Cannot connect to local provider\" which is confusing. Maybe we should show a notification error in `getTargetNetwork` (alongside the the console.error) and return undefined.\r\n",

It'll take some time to get this right, but let's keep exploring this approach.\r\n- wagmi/cli as @technophile-04 suggested, might be a good solution when everything works :D It's super new, so let's see how it evolves\r\n- _(from my fuzzy brain)_ I still think there should be a way to tweak `useDeployedContractInfo` / or passing a TS generic (with the ABI?) somewhere to get the types for the contract data. Anyway, it's no clear in my head right yet haha. Converting JSON to TS, seems to be needed.\r\n\r\n**The biggest DX issue that we have right now:**\r\n![b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486142/220172561-d4385262-c151-4473-8beb-dbd77f51a03f.png)\r\n![a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486142/220172568-9c775245-f3be-4de3-9e1e-c018df8dc32e.png)\r\n\r\nSince `data` in unknown we get the `ReactNode` error. It won't happen if data is `any`. Can we make that happen as v0.1? Creating an issue for it. https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/issues/189\r\n\r\nIf we fix that, we won't have autocompletions / type inference, but at least you can use data freely.\r\n\r\n> remove generated folder from gitignore, since typings rely on generated/hardhat_contracts file\r\n\r\nThe best solution would be that the generation happens on the build step, i.e. running the hardhat node + deploy on build.\r\n\r\nThanks all! I'll keep iterating on this.",

      "body": "> Why do we need to maintain uncontrolled behavior? For users who will decide to use forms?\r\n\r\nIt started with the `AddressInput` component. Adding the uncontrolled behav was basically adding this line (+ some checks):\r\n```ts\r\n  const currentValue = value !== undefined ? value : address || \"\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nBesides using forms (on regular HTML inputs, you have the option of use them as controlled VS uncontrolled, even if the controlled way is the recommended way)... I liked the idea of adding `<AddressInput />` into the page with no props and you could see the component doing its work (ens resolution, ens avatar, blockie, etc). Maybe a silly thing, but adding it was trivial.\r\n\r\nI though it was a good idea to for the `EtherInput` component too. But it's more complex by nature, and yep, the controlled input was broken (in a weird way) but also working in \"controlled\" & \"uncontrolled\" mode (in a weird way :D)\r\n\r\nI like the component refactor in this PR (way more clean now), but I don't think it's working as I understand it should:\r\n\r\n**Uncontrolled:**\r\n- `<EtherInput />` This doesn't work. It works on main.\r\n\r\n**Controlled**\r\n- `<EtherInput value=\"12\" />`. This shows the correct value of 12 (and its USD value), but it let you change the ETH value on the input (it shouldn't in a controlled component). Same error in main (+ doesn't show the init value). It doesn't make sense to use the component like this tho, but, it tell us that we are not handling the \"controlled\" input the right way.\r\n- `<EtherInput value={amount} onChange={v => setAmount(v)} />`. This works perfectly, better than the exiting main, since it takes in consideration the init value.\r\n\r\n\r\n> upd. It looks like you changed all the inputs behavior to controlled in https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/220 . Probably we're wasting time trying to make it work for uncontrolled\r\n\r\nIt all boils to this. What do you all think? My opinion:\r\n\r\n- Make uncontrolled work if it doesn't take too much effort / complexity. \r\n  - If it does, nix it (I think #220 does it by making onChange mandatory)\r\n- Make the controlled version work as it should. (#220 has the same problem, where you can still change the input on a hardcoded value and not update).\r\n\r\nIn any case, we are not wasting time! :P These tinkering / discussions are good for the project.\r\n\r\nThank you all <3\r\n\r\n",

Can we think about other use case? Since we are in the front-end, 99.99% of the times we'll want to use the connected signer (besides the faucet, and maybe a exotic build where we do deterministic private key derivation or something)\r\n- `getBlockExplorerTxLink` doesn't return anything for the local chain (the only instance where we are using a custom signer for the transactor :thinking: )\r\n- `getLocalProvider` is only used in the Faucet stuff. Could be an unneeded early abstraction.\r\n- Maybe an util like `getChainFromChainId` that returns a wagmi Chain for a given Id?\r\n\r\nIn any case, no need to make any updates rn!! just thinking out loud and pointing out some possible inconsistencies. Maybe we made some past decisions that could use some refactors for the sake of consistency / simplicity / better DX.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

      "body": "> Moved scaffold.config to root and same is being utilised by both next and hardhat\r\n\r\nThis is great! I think having an unique config file it's more dx friendly. A few thoughts/questions: \r\n\r\n- Could/Should we add a single source of truth here about networks? We have the `networks.ts` file on next, and we use the networks also in `hardhat.config.ts`. I'm just wondering if we could define a network object with all the data we need in scaffold.config, for hardhat & next (wagmi) to use. \"Networks\" feel like a key & transversal piece for SE-2 (or any dApp)\r\n- Should we also support env vars in the config file? Specifically for secrets, since people are going to commit the config file. Things like \"DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY\" or even alchemy/infura keys that could live in config.\r\n```ts\r\nconst scaffoldConfig: ScaffoldConfig = {\r\n\ttargetNetwork: chain.hardhat,\r\n\tpollingInterval: 30000,\r\n        deployerdPrivateKey: process.env.DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY\r\n} as const;\r\n```\r\nI think we'll just need the dotenv package on the root. Handling all the config & env vars in the root seems more friendly. I think it will work on Vercel when manually defining the env vars in their UI.\r\n\r\nThis is just me thinking out loud, would love to hear your view on it.\r\n\r\n> btw I came across some patterns where people have created config directory similar to nextjs and harhdat where all the base configurations live like .eslintrc, .tsconfig etc, just wanted to put here since we are in \"refactoring phase\" :) and also we can put scaffold.config inside it. I like the way currently it is now but would love to know others thought\r\n> I'm used to those types of config files being at the root of their package, that's where I would generally look for them, so it doesn't bother me personally.\r\n\r\nSince this is a monorepo with two packages, it also doesn't bother me having separate config files. But I've also seen monorepos with a **shared** (or config) directory.. I guess it's an alternative to having everything shared in the root (when is too bloated). It's definitely something that we should explore, but maybe in the future / another PR? This PR is already a big refactor.",

So that you don't get a yellow squiggly line if you don't have your IDE configured properly and do it manually? Just thinking out loud and we can for sure ignore this suggestion !!\r\n\r\nTested it and loved it! Thanks for the suggestion.

      "body": "Great job @technophile-04 \r\n\r\nI think we are not far, but still doesn't feel 100% right to me.\r\n\r\n### 1. Vercel root directory\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-16 at 2 40 32 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80153681/225569118-da97971f-96ba-4dbd-b45d-d2a1ccc08fcf.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt might be like a little thing, but for me, it decreases the deploy experience by a bunch. I tried to search for options for the CLI / vercel.json config file, but it doesn't seem that you can provide a default `root directory` option. The `--cwd` option doesn't work either.\r\n\r\nNot sure what we could try.\r\n\r\n### 2. .env vars\r\n\r\n> If we plan to have global env's then implement them, checkout out the last section for resistance faced https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/231#issuecomment-1470438008\r\n\r\nI think we need .env vars for secrets. \r\n\r\n**Answer 1**\r\nRight now on `scaffold.config.ts`:\r\n```ts\r\nconst scaffoldConfig: ScaffoldConfig = {\r\n  // ....\r\n  deployerPrivateKey:\r\n    \"0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80\",\r\n // ..\r\n} as const;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then `const deployerPrivateKey = process.env.DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY ?? scaffoldConfig.deployerPrivateKey;` on `hardhat.config.ts`. It's confusing, since we have the `deployerPrivateKey` on the config file and it's not clear that people need to create a `.env` file inside the hardhat folder\r\n\r\nI think it should be:\r\n```ts\r\nconst scaffoldConfig: ScaffoldConfig = {\r\n  // ....\r\n  deployerPrivateKey: process.env.deployerPrivateKey || \r\n    \"0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80\",\r\n // ..\r\n} as const;\r\n```\r\nSo people can create a `.env` file in the root folder (we might have a `.env.example`) that it's meant for secrets. And secrets consumers just read `scaffoldConfig.deployerPrivateKey`. Same for `alchemyApiKey` and `etherscanApiKey`.\r\n\r\nAnd make sure people understand that they should never use `scaffoldConfig` to store secrets directly (even if we are doing so :sweat_smile:)\r\n\r\nMaybe we could pass the secrets/env vars like this to Vercel:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486142/225676113-6b2d92e7-55d5-4967-ae80-aa3356b655a5.png)\r\n\r\nIf people create/update an env var from the Vercel UI, they will take effect if they rebuild (they are being used on the scaffold.config.file)?\r\n\r\n**Answer 2**\r\n\r\nUse `scaffold.config.ts` only for public variables (targetNetwork && pollingInterval), and handle the secrets env vars in its own package:\r\n- **Hardhat.**. Same as in main (.env file)\r\n- **NextJS**.  We'd replace `.env.*` with the config file, but people could still use `.env` / `.env.local` / Vercel UI to set up secrets and use them in their API routes or whatever.\r\n\r\nThis way we don't mix config & secret env vars... and things might be simpler.\r\n\r\n> Handle this properly https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/231#discussion_r1132625398\r\n\r\nThis is not a big deal for now. We could create an issue for that refactor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDefinitely having a root config file makes things a bit more complicated. I'll be up for it if we find a nice balance. But https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/231#issuecomment-1471517364 is still on my mind.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n",

We solved that using the `satisfies` operator.\r\n\r\nThe issue then is that TS complains when we compare `scaffoldConfig.targetNetwork.id` (resolved to a specific number) with another specific number. \"Types have no overlap\". We need to assert the type (as number) to remove the error.\r\n\r\nI don't love the casting here, seems counterintuitive, since you are working with the wagmi Chain type, but it's not really resolving as such. But I could live with it.\r\n\r\nJust throwing another idea, and see if you all think it's worth implementing it:\r\n\r\nAs we had before https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/246, have a `getTargetNetwork` util than returns the selected network in config:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst getTargetNetwork = (): Chain => { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo benefits I see:\r\n- It solves this error.\r\n- We can directly access the config when we need the specific value (for #202)\r\n- We could extend the targetNetwork value there (e.g. adding the colors)\r\n- It's a wrapper, so if we ever change the way of defining the targetNetwork, we'd just need to change it here (e.g. we move the scaffold.config to the root).\r\n\r\nShiv already mentioned why he decided to remove this extra function in https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/246#discussion_r1139234630. But with this in mind, maybe our reasoning is different.\r\n\r\nAnyway, not feeling super strong about this, just wanted to put it out there and see what you all think.\r\n\r\nHappy to merge as it's.\r\n\r\ncc @technophile-04 @rin-st @sverps \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

      "body": "Thanks @sverps \r\n\r\nFrom #249\r\n\r\n> I think a more intuitive behavior is to disable the hook when we know it would result in an error, and only call the contract function when the params are good. That way, the types force a dev to plug in correctly typed variables for args, and when a user using the UI does some action (i.e. fill in a form) that actually provides a value for the variables, only then is the actual contract function called.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we are only checking if one of the args is undefined, so yes, we avoid a bunch of console errors in the case that a **read Hook has multiple arguments and the builder uses a form** (until the user starts typing in the last argument input).\r\n\r\nIf it only takes 1 args:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst [address, setAddress] = useState(\"\");\r\n\r\nconst { data } = useScaffoldContractRead({\r\n  contractName: \"YourContract\",\r\n  functionName: \"userGreetingCounter\",\r\n  args: [address],\r\n});\r\n\r\nreturn (\r\n  <>\r\n    <AddressInput value={address} onChange={v => setAddress(v)} />\r\n    <p>{data?.toString()}</p>\r\n  </>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, you'd still get all the errors, right? You might save *1* error if you use `useState<string | undefined>();` on load.\r\n\r\n> Reduce contract calls (or at least reduce triggers of the wagmi hook)\r\n\r\nYes, I think the contract is never called (RPC calls not fired) until the args are OK. We just get the errors from Ethers (that wagmi uses under the hood)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe can definitely merge this, but I guess a better solution could be to check if the args are **valid** depending on their type (Address, number, etc)\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

We are using JSON.stringify(dep), but the linter is not capable of inferring it. Using this method might be problematic on big objects / objects with circular references... but in this case, they will be small objects with one/few props.\r\n\r\nMy vote would be to add:\r\n// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

BUT doesn't run the `generateTsAbis` script. It's because the `--watch` doesn't let the deploy command exit.\r\n\r\nWe should find a fix for that!",

      "body": "Hey all! I've been testing this, and everything seems to be working great. Amazing work @portdeveloper and @technophile-04. This is going to be a great addition.\r\n\r\nI think we need to fix some styling before merging. I promise these will be the latest requests :D Since it's a really big PR, I'm sure we'll find some issues later, but we can handle them in a different PR.\r\n\r\n### 1. Everything is huge\r\n\r\nMost of the buttons, text, tabs, etc are really big compared to other (existing) elements of the page.\r\n\r\nEg: \r\n![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/assets/2486142/215738a1-866b-4a7d-8dd3-be46977db0f5)\r\n![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/assets/2486142/c5b9dfa6-c7c5-4f98-9d92-742ab32ec8ac)\r\n\r\nLet's remove all the `*-lg` stuff. It should be regular sizes (no modifier) and in some cases `*-sm` (buttons, maybe some texts)\r\n\r\n### 2. Light mode\r\n\r\n2.1 There is no background color here, all is floating on the page (dark mode looks great tho):\r\n![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/assets/2486142/7fad23bb-8430-49bc-9a2a-43f58d635579)\r\n\r\n2.2 Not important but the table has no zebra style (maybe we need to tweak something in the tailwind styles?). Also, no need to tackle this here if we don't want to.\r\n![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/assets/2486142/76fe5e89-6cb0-4301-9ad7-02eb357019f3)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n1 and 2.1 are bugging me, but other than that... everything looks great.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to work on this too, if you guys are not sure about some of the stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We can't automatically add every single thing that _could_ be useful on SE-2... we'd end with a massive project.

If I use it from outside git repo it works as expected\r\n\r\nYep, this was happening when running it inside an existing git repo (because of the postinstall yarn hook). Your fix works perfectly, but it leaves the `yarn.lock` file uncommitted (changed after running `yarn install`**), so we decided to take a different approach (git init before yarn install, but add & commit after yarn install) and it seems to work. @technophile-04 will push in a bit.\r\n\r\n** This is expected since we have an empty `yarn.lock` file, to avoid conflicts when we have a bunch of extensions. So it's generated on the first install. In package.json files, we changed ^ for ~, so with packages bugfixes there is less risk of something breaking (we tried to do exact versions in package.json, but for some reason the peer-dependencies weren't installing)\r\n\r\n> On Windows (both my desk and laptop) it's working like a charm when I choose hardhat, but when I choose foundry, I got problems to yarn chain.\r\n\r\nThanks @Pabl0cks ! Yes, this happens because people need to install foundryup (that contains anvil and some other tools) in their **system**. What we are going to do is check if they have it installed and if not show a message hinting them to install.\r\n\r\nWe'll be pushing (& publishing) in a bit.\r\n\r\nThanks all!",

Thanks for this!\r\n\r\nIn SE-1, there are hundreds of branches that people contributed, showcasing a huge variety of use cases for web3 apps that people could use as templates.\r\n\r\nIn SE-2, we didn't embrace the same model, since we don't think branches are meant for that. They are now primarily used for isolating feature development & bug fixing. This helps us maintain a clear and organized development workflow.\r\n\r\nWe don't have a great system for showcasing community builds right now (but it's on the roadmap!**). I think the best you can do is create your build in your BG profile (https://app.buidlguidl.com/) so people can find it in the /builds route. \r\n\r\n** The idea is to improve the current /builds page, with tagging / filter search / etc.\r\n\r\nThanks again!",

It can apply prettier when saving a given file. If not, you are using single quotes, missing spaces, etc.\r\n- You didn't include the updated `yarn.lock`.\r\n- Did you follow the Migration guide from Nexthttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration.? It seems that you didn't update react / react-dom / eslint-config-next. Also there are some things (like migrating next/head[https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration#step-3-migrating-nexthead]) that you didn't include. Not sure if it was on purpose (to make a progressive migration)\r\n\r\n",

It's much more convenient than using components folder. So probably it will be better to move page specific components to _components folders in every page. This is negotiable and doesn't need to be done just now. @carletex @technophile-04 what do you think?\r\n\r\nI like this idea. So we will move blockexplorer / example-ui from the root \"components\" to a \"_components\" folder inside the corresponding route, right? What about the Header / Footer, etc and the `scaffold-eth` component folder? Would we leave it as it is?\r\n\r\nWill also like to know what @technophile-04 thinks!",

I'll comment soon.\r\n\r\nThe other option is locking the version in `package.json` but I feel you guys don't like that? I don't see any issues taking that approach. When we want to update we just update the version manually (which arguably makes us more conscious about updating / the version we are updating to), or even temporarily adding `^` before updating a given dependency and locking it later. Maybe not as convenient as just running `yarn update` on a given dependency... by it's definitely better than having a version mismatch between the local & prod env. Am I missing something?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAlso for this PR: Shouldn't we just update viem (so it saves in the .lock file executed locally).

      "body": "Thanks for testing this out @technophile-04!\r\n\r\nAs I understand by looking at the changed code, this prebuilds the projects and then deploys (so it uses the yarn.lock file), right?. It's a cool solution, but will only solve when deploying from the cli (I guess most people do that? I always do it by connecting the GitHub repo from the Vercel UI). Also, some of the prompts are a bit confusing. I like the default `--prod` tho.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we'd want to solve this issue completely. I guess right now it's pnpm vs. locking versions on package.json... which also have their drawbacks.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?",

      "body": "Hey @technophile-04! Thank you so much for the write-up & context. Now I see everything more clearly. Some of the stuff you mentioned was on my notes (I was planning to post it in the pnpm PR, but will do it here)\r\n\r\nI had a wall of text haha, but since you already did a great job given all the context, let me just comment on it and propose next steps.\r\n\r\n> main issue : \"Version mismatch between the local & prod env\" i.e. https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/issues/419\r\n\r\nExactly. This is the most «critical» issue. We thought that having separate lock files would fix it (which it will!), but It was weird to me that not so many people were using that feature (and is not present in other package managers) & it seemed a bit unstable.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue (you are 100% right, it's not an issue when connecting repo in Vercel UI) in a better way :rocket: \r\n\r\n### CLI\r\n\r\n> Locking versions in package.json makes sense there since we don't have .lock files and up for it 🙌 (We already using ~ their instead of ^)\r\n> Not sure about adding .lock files by default. I mean currently its fine because we just have plain SE-2  next but when add extensions like TheGrpah then we will be needing to add more packages to plain SE-2 next which might not be easy\r\n\r\nAgree with what you said. We can lock versions in package.json (or ~)... and yeah, it can get messy pre-generating `.lock` files (as you said, extensions might add some deps to other extensions). Maybe, if we want to super-optimize, we could generate a couple of global `.lock` files (nextjs + hardhat / nextjs + foundry). It'd improve performance for the most used option (but this is future future haha)\r\n\r\nso...\r\n\r\n### PNPM\r\n\r\nIf I remember correctly the main reason we started thinking about PNPM was **the issue that this PR is fixing**:\r\n\r\n> Also just mentioning pnpm here 😅 (It's workspaces has this option to create separate lock files) ....I tried it out and its really good also we might also benefit from it using it in our CLI due to its some what faster installations\r\n\r\n(Shiv on https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/issues/419#issuecomment-1637115179)\r\n\r\nYes, I get it, pnpm is fancy and faster (especially if we disabled the per-package lock files) but I don't think it's worth it at this point. It has some issues on Windows (the env vars), and IT'S DAMN HARD TO WRITE, READ AND SAY haha \r\n\r\nSo now I change my 51% (pnpm) / 49% (yarn) vote to 1% (pnpm) / 99% (yarn)... and I'd keep an eye on Bun. It could be a nice option to improve performance. BTW, I think yarn gets a lot of shit, but I think v3 is good & fast enough.\r\n\r\nThoughts? \r\n",

(and I think people will like it too). It might be tricky a bit tricky for the docs (when running the commands):\r\n\r\n```<your_package_manager> run deploy```\r\n\r\nhaha. Anyway, we can think about this in future iterations\r\n\r\n> I tried it. For now, it's not so good for monorepos, for example you can't use scripts from your workspaces in main package.json. But as I understand they're adding features fast so I'm planning to check how it works from time to time\r\n> Yup yup, I think incase in the future if we plan to change package manage bun might be better options hopefully bun will get more stable by then\r\n\r\nYes, let's keep an eye on it and see how it evolves. We can rethink in a few months. \r\n\r\n> How to write and say it, I don't care. Probably because I don't speak about it 😄 .\r\n\r\n:rofl: yeah, that's a complain I got from Austin (I agree tho), since he makes a bunch on live workshops / videos, etc. But like you said, it's a \"breaking change\".  \r\n\r\n> if not we can close this PR and even https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/pull/444 (feeling sad saying this 🥲 lol no JK 😂)\r\n\r\nhahah. I'm super glad we explored & tinkered with that option. But we realized that it's not optimal for us. So... great work <3\r\n\r\n> So I am leaning towards removing ^ from package.json for now\r\n> Maybe since https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/pull/541 was solved we could wait over this weekend\r\n\r\nLet's regroup next week and see.\r\n\r\nThanks all!!

I think this is exactly what @rin-st was talking about here: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/pull/541#issuecomment-1734204842\r\n\r\nEven if we install the same top dep (5.0.4) it uses a newer version of `@types/react`. Why? Because package.json file of `@types/react-copy-to-clipboard`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n        \"@types/react\": \"*\"\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n:cry: \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSo not having a lockfile is tricky.\r\n\r\nWe can remove `~`, but things can always break in the future because a new release of sub-dependency updates and breaks something.\r\n\r\nA decent solution:\r\n- Remove `~`\r\n- Have some kind of automated testing that runs every day, installs SE-2 with different options, runs some commands, and checks errors. That way we can identify issues early.\r\n\r\nNot ideal, but better than nothing.\r\n\r\nThoughts? \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAlso check this comment: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/pull/555#discussion_r1345630966\r\n\r\nThis could help for errors related to `@types` packages\r\n\r\n",

But yeah, the risk is there\r\n\r\n> It will be really hard for us to debug too right ? Since A might using sum very deep down which causes some of A api's break which we are using in SE-2 also this will be hard to catch in automated tests?\r\n\r\nIf we have good automated tests, I guess we could detect that something is not working (deploy, start, checking types, etc), right? And the we can investigate the root of it and fix it (it'll prolly be a versions that needs to be updated)\r\n\r\nI think I'm gonna update @types to ^ for now.\r\n\r\n> Also btw I think we should make a quick another patch PR cli because npx create-eth@latest is broken now because of this\r\n\r\nMaybe we can merge this one?

Are you saying that we should use wagmi's autoconnect or not? I'd be great if we can do so, but thought that we were encountering some issues.\r\n\r\n> The more I explore the more I feel NextJs app router still feels not prod-ready at least in the context of web 3.0.\r\n\r\nThat's what I thought the first time I tried App routing a few months ago. It got a bit better, but it seems that it's not there yet.\r\n\r\n> Umm just a thought but maybe we should have 2 versions of se-2 pages(main branch) ,app router branch and maybe option two option in CLI, until wagmi2.0 is released (because wagmi seems main backbone of SE-2 and they seem to be not ready yet).\r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity...Maybe we can just wait until wagmi fixs it and take on this PR again? And keep using the page router.... which is working consistently. Open to ideas tho.",

(please feel free to suggest an alternate name)\r\n\r\nWe definitely need to change `generated/` to `contracts/`.  `deployedContracts` I think it covers both: \"external\" contracts + contracts deployed with SE-2. Both are deployed contracts, right? :D\r\n\r\n`index.ts` follows the convention. The only reason I don't like it is because there are a bunch of index.ts files in the project (barrel files most of them)... and it'd be hard to navigate (at least how I do it: CTRL + P, start typing \"deploy...\" and enter). But maybe `contracts/deployedContracts.ts` is too redundant.\r\n\r\nIDK, I'd love to hear what others think too.",

      "body": "> Downside of putting everything in the same file is running yarn deploy seems to overwrite the whole file, and thus it removes any manually added external contracts. So this approach requires changing 99_generateTsAbis.ts to parse the existing file and ensure external contracts are kept. This would require some sort of deep merge, which might not always do exactly what the user expects (e.g. a user that changes a contract name might still see his old contract show up in addition to the newly named one, since our deepMerge would not know if an existing definition is an old deployment, or a user added external contract).\r\n\r\nThis is a great point.\r\n\r\nIf we can figure out the Types for the 2-files approach, it's definitely the way to go (`deployedContracts.ts` & `externalContracts.ts`). \r\n\r\nThanks @technophile-04 & @sverps !!",

Appreciate the nitpicking @Pabl0cks \r\n\r\nSince we are at it, fixed a few little things:\r\n\r\n- More subtle color for the struct title\r\n- Align internal padding with inputs\r\n- Spacing between label / input or struct (1 => 1.5)\r\n- Increase left padding of label (if not, because of the input/struct border radius, felt that was non-aligned)\r\n- The difference of the radius (between inputs and structs) still bugs me, but cant have full radius on accordions.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/assets/2486142/873fad13-dc20-463c-87b9-92eebfa8d19e)\r\n\r\n- Added the label to value fields (thanks for the snippet @technophile-04 !!)\r\n-  I used \"payable value\". Not sure if the best option, but I wanted the \"payable\" word to be there.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/assets/2486142/44a7a147-0113-4c2f-ab7d-3ee5df5b86ad)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

And all for the discussion.\r\n\r\nI think having this makes sense, since [wagmi removed](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/migrate-from-v1-to-v2#removed-watch-property) the watch prop in most hooks. In #700 we abstracted for builders in our hooks so they can still use `watch`. But not with the `useBalance` one, so this PR makes sense.\r\n\r\nRegarding the name, I don't have a strong opinion, but If I had to vote, I'd say:\r\n\r\n:1st_place_medal:   `useWatchBalance` (or `useBalanceWatch` `useWatchedBalance`). This will make a lot of sense if we remove the `watch` argument as Damu said (if you don't want to `watch` you can use wagmi's `useBalance` directly)\r\n\r\n:2nd_place_medal:  But I also like the current name `useAccountBalance` or `useScaffoldBalance` (consistent with other hooks names) if we want to keep the watch prop.\r\n\r\nAnything works in my mind tho!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Looks like it's redundant\r\n\r\nThe USD mode only makes sense when we have a price for the native currency. If it's loading (or if the fetch fails) it doesn't make sense to show the USD mode... since you won't be able to convert to the native currency (which is what we want for any onchain operation / show balance, etc). So I think that was the reason.\r\n\r\n> Rename usdMode to defaultUsdMode and use that value as default in useState. Remove useEffect. (I prefer this)\r\n\r\nThis will only work if we ignore my previous comment (the price condition). I agree that `defaultUsdMode` might be a better name.\r\n\r\n> Remove inner usd/eth logic. Use only usdMode prop (or mode)\r\n\r\nI don't like this one since it'd require people to do their logic for the basic toggle USD / ETH.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if these components need a refactor, but like you said, it should probably happen in another PR.\r\n\r\nI just created this one as a hotfix, to tackle a bug that is currently happening on main (and tried to be consistent with other components)\r\n",

The problem is that the RPC is not _failing_ (where the fallback would work)... it's just returning incorrect stuff.\r\n\r\nI guess **wevm** people noticed it too because they changed it on `viem` last month https://github.com/wevm/viem/commit/79a183046b92f90d3e8ce707fe1e28b4523d7e5e. I guess it'd come with the newer versions of wagmi/view.\r\n\r\nA couple of solution could be:\r\n1. If this is mainly Sepolia, let's just update and leave the RPC order as it was.\r\n   - PROS: \r\n     - Our alchemy key won't suffer\r\n   - CONS: \r\n       - public RPCs tend to fail\r\n       - If people change to use their alchemy key... it'd still fail because it's the fallback (A weird hack would be to detect if a different API is being used... if so, make alchemy the default)\r\n2. If it's a general thing, let's tweak the order. \r\n   - PROS:\r\n     - Works most of the time (unless limits are hit)\r\n   - CONS:\r\n     - People killing our RPC\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Hey all! \r\n\r\nI spend the morning with Pablo & Shiv (live in Spain!) tinkering with this.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion: non-deterministic things sucks :D\r\n\r\nWe tested 3 versions of the rules files (aso Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7. 3.7 was usually better):\r\n\r\n1. Port's version (you can rollback to this commit to test https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/pull/966/commits/6033ca669cbc5cc1b2ee21569a03dfba99d6c064)\r\n\r\n- This was fast, and got the hooks right (sometimes not in the first try, but it auto-fixed)\r\n- Besides the read/write hooks, it didn't use the \"scaffold-way\" most of the times: Address component, yarn start (was doing yarn dev inside nextjs folder), etc.\r\n\r\n2. Full LLM file pasted into the rules: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/llms-full.txt\r\n\r\n- This was a slower and results similar to Port's (but was slightly better on the scaffold-way)\r\n\r\n3. The current version of this PR: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/pull/966/commits/a20fb77f8f29db55b6efcae121a64847749db293\r\n\r\nWe came to this version after a few tries and I think it has the best of both. Fast & scaffold-aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have to say that most of the tries one-shotted (even if it had to auto correct some times)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis is what we did for testing:\r\n\r\n- We start with cursor with a clean SE-2 install (no chain running, etc)\r\n- First prompt:\r\n```\r\nI want to modify the exiting smart contract and add a delegate feature.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the contract will be able to set a delegate. And the the delegate will be able to witdraw from the contract (as the owner)\r\n\r\nThen I want to create a custom UI (in the homepage) where the current delegate is display, and a input + button the update the delegate with a new Delegate Address.\r\n```\r\n\r\n(this should create a working version and should run chain / deploy /start)\r\n\r\n- When is worklng, second prompt:`\r\n```\r\nCan you change the Owner to be \"<WHATEVER_BURNER_ADDRESS>\"?\r\n```\r\n\r\n(this should modify the script + run yarn deploy again)\r\n\r\n- Last prompt:\r\n```\r\nHow could I deploy this to Sepolia? Don't do it, just tell me the steps to follow.\r\n```\r\n\r\n(beside the basics, it should mention vercel and ipfs and hint to modify scaffold-config with the network).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nLet's do a round of testing and see if we are happy with the results!

Maybe some other ideas?\r\n\r\nI like the approach, and I think this could make a lot of sense. I agree with the PROS / CONS. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSomething that we could discuss: where should we draw the line between just tailwind classes & components.\r\n\r\n=> It's clear to me that modals (and similar) should be a Component (because they have some custom styling + \"JS\" functionality). \r\n\r\n=>  On the other side, it's not that clear for things like buttons, since it's _only_ styling. I guess the alternative would be to create some extra utility classes (using `@apply`?) like btn-primary, btn-sm, etc. This applies to things like badges, links, (tooltips?), etc.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there would be a nice dynamic way to create variations with themes/colors/sizes for all of these utility classes.\r\n\r\nPushing back on myself: if we are expecting people to use either raw TW or Shadcn, maybe the approach of having `button`, etc as components is not a bad idea.\r\n\r\nBut yes, for me, not relying on custom components for simpler things seems better. I feel that it makes SE-2 less opinionated and closer to HTML / CSS. People can always create their own components (custom, shadcn, etc)\r\n\r\nAnyway, just opening the discussion! Let me know what you all think!\r\n\r\nThanks again!!!",

To deploy a module, you must export it using module.exports = or export default. As a best practice, we suggest maintaining one module per file, naming the file after the module ID.\n```\n\nBut I couldn't make it work (creating more modules in the file + exporting both)\n\n---\n\nNote: they also have https://hardhat.org/ignition/docs/guides/scripts, where you can do more \"complex\" logic (e.g. console.logs of contract read data)\n\n",

      "body": "Hey Tam,\r\n\r\nBefore going into technical details, I have to say that your attitude here comes as a surprise to me. Not sure where that's coming from, but definitely not something we are used to inside the BG. I want to think that this would sound different in a conversation, and your writing might sound worse than it really is.\r\n\r\nI get that if you are only working on this, you feel left aside when we are not paying attention to your PR/issue. But we are a team working on dozens of issues / PR / projects inside the BG, and we prioritize and tackle things as we consider is the best way.\r\n\r\nOk, back to the tech details:\r\n\r\n> I pinged @carletex about it, who said\r\n> > Cool, that makes sense! I think the goal of the PR is great, so that's a big thumbs up!\r\n\r\n> Therefore I spent 2-3 weeks to finalise the PR, but now you say that the idea is not a good one.\r\n\r\nNo one is telling you that. We all thought this was a good idea, but what Shiv is telling you here is that this approach doesn't work for us. It completely breaks the core principles of the `create-eth` projects. This PR hacks the way `create-eth` works, and we don't want that at all. This is something we have been discussing a lot: maybe the last time was here https://github.com/scaffold-eth/create-eth/issues/170, which was sparked by your issue.\r\n\r\n> Also, with the current extension system, my demo branch cannot be turned into an extension.\r\n\r\nThat's a different problem. As you can see on the beta branch, we are rewriting a bunch of things on the template system to allow more use cases (feedback from extension builders). Again #170\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nShiv gave you really good feedback here, detailing how this feature should work: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/create-eth/pull/205#issuecomment-2671047654, but it seems that you ignored it. That's how I thought this would work: since we already have `yarn create-extension` working, we should just tweak it a bit to support projects not started with create-eth (probably creating a diff between last commit and {commitHash} would work)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLeaving the most important part for the end: I'm really open to discuss tech details, iterate, argue, disagree etc, but if you want to collaborate with us, please be kind in your messages. Some of us worked really hard to assemble a tight team with good communication and attitude, and I won't let anything disturb that.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If we can generate both llm files on `build` it would be amazing, so we don't need to anything special when creating a PR (and doing it on build it's probably better than generating them with a GitHub action, as I initially suggested)\r\n\r\nI started to review the PR but got discouraged. There are a bunch of things that don't make sense/confusing/under-optimized (I'm guessing vibe coding) in 500+ lines of code. In this particular case (SE-2 docs) not sure if it makes sense to spend the required time to do a proper review.... which is a bit sad. So maybe if it works, we should just move forward.\r\n\r\nWhat we need to change is the hardcoded part, there are parts that don't make sense to me.

Let's place the tooltip in another position. Usually you hover the challenges from top to bottom.  It's a bit weird to just run over the tooltip when hovering (and also hides the next item). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"471\" height=\"353\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8cb48b1-3482-476d-88a0-725ebb776934\" />\r\n\r\nMaybe on the right?\r\n\r\n3. I think we could have better descriptions for the tootlip. I think we can be more specific about what you are going to learn / need to apply. (we can also remove the \"mint your flag\", \"interact with challenge X\", etc). IF not, it feels a bit vague?\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\"Mint your flag in this unverified contract.\" => \"Analyze the bytecode of a unverified contract\" or just \"bytecode on unverified contract\"\r\n\"Mint your flag using the right signature.\" => \"Craft a signature of a known PK\" or just \"Crafting signatures\"\r\n\r\nReally open on this one, what do you think?

Not sure what's the best option to handle this. For now a link to Etherescan / Rainbow could be good (and then we can thing about building somehting ourselves, like a page with a QR / connect wallet / whatever)\r\n- Could you change the style of the \"Donate\" link? Instead of a regular link, a button with some background.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think all of these are small things, but also feel free to leave stuff for the next PR.\r\n\r\nThanks man!\r\n\r\n",
