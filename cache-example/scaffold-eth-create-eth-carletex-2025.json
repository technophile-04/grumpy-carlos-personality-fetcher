Let's add all the breaking changes to this branch.\r\n- When ready:\r\n  - Let's prepare the extension to work with the breaking changes (e.g. in a __beta branch) + test with the beta deployed version\r\n  - Merge beta => main.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?",

      "body": "Hey Tam,\r\n\r\nBefore going into technical details, I have to say that your attitude here comes as a surprise to me. Not sure where that's coming from, but definitely not something we are used to inside the BG. I want to think that this would sound different in a conversation, and your writing might sound worse than it really is.\r\n\r\nI get that if you are only working on this, you feel left aside when we are not paying attention to your PR/issue. But we are a team working on dozens of issues / PR / projects inside the BG, and we prioritize and tackle things as we consider is the best way.\r\n\r\nOk, back to the tech details:\r\n\r\n> I pinged @carletex about it, who said\r\n> > Cool, that makes sense! I think the goal of the PR is great, so that's a big thumbs up!\r\n\r\n> Therefore I spent 2-3 weeks to finalise the PR, but now you say that the idea is not a good one.\r\n\r\nNo one is telling you that. We all thought this was a good idea, but what Shiv is telling you here is that this approach doesn't work for us. It completely breaks the core principles of the `create-eth` projects. This PR hacks the way `create-eth` works, and we don't want that at all. This is something we have been discussing a lot: maybe the last time was here https://github.com/scaffold-eth/create-eth/issues/170, which was sparked by your issue.\r\n\r\n> Also, with the current extension system, my demo branch cannot be turned into an extension.\r\n\r\nThat's a different problem. As you can see on the beta branch, we are rewriting a bunch of things on the template system to allow more use cases (feedback from extension builders). Again #170\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nShiv gave you really good feedback here, detailing how this feature should work: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/create-eth/pull/205#issuecomment-2671047654, but it seems that you ignored it. That's how I thought this would work: since we already have `yarn create-extension` working, we should just tweak it a bit to support projects not started with create-eth (probably creating a diff between last commit and {commitHash} would work)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLeaving the most important part for the end: I'm really open to discuss tech details, iterate, argue, disagree etc, but if you want to collaborate with us, please be kind in your messages. Some of us worked really hard to assemble a tight team with good communication and attitude, and I won't let anything disturb that.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
