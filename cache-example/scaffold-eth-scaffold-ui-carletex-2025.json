Super helpful.\r\n\r\nRegarding the **rounding error**: I explored your suggestions and ended up with: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-ui/pull/11/commits/c112f2812301c34f0aa52f75ed37155771e73236.\r\n\r\nIt's basically separating the display mode (what currency the UI shows) from the source mode (what currency the typed value represents). Now, toggling only flips the display without mutating the original typed value (eliminating the floating error). The component preserves the user's exact input until they actually start typing in the opposite currency mode (where we switch the source currency to match what they're now editing). \r\n\r\nIt's making the component \"smarter\" and leaving the hook as it is (removing the activeValue).\r\n\r\nWdyt?\r\n\r\n> What do you think guys about keeping InputBase in components and building EtherInput/AddressInput/maybe more on top of it the same way as it was before, so our inputs will have the same styles? It could be internal component without import\r\n\r\nYes! I think this is good idea. I might copy it from your PR.\r\n\r\n> Not sure though if we should have two components ( internal controlled / uncontrolled).\r\n\r\noh no! Agree. My plan was just to create it in the PR so we can compare and test... but once we decide, let's remove the one we don't like.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the decision is between: internally controlled (current PR, controlled inside the component) VS externally controlled (controlled by the user of the component). I don't think we want to do _uncontrolled_ (but happy to test if you think it's worth it!)\r\n\r\nI guess what we decide should be applied to #12 too?\r\n\r\n> useEtherInput has nothing about input. Probably we could name hooks differently. For example if name it like useEthUsdConvertation, it can be used not only in inputs\r\n\r\nAlso thought about this when creating it. Agree that's not the best naming... but in the other hand, having a the correlation between component / hook can make sense? I'm 50/50 on it :D\r\n\r\nrelated: do we need `useAddressInput` hook? Or could we just have `useAddress` hook and then `Address` and `AddressInput` components using that hook?\r\n\r\nSorry, opening a lot of threads in the discussion haha\r\n\r\nBut thank you, this is super enriching 👾",

I've never used that patter before for this, but make sense?\r\n\r\n**internall vs externally controlled**\r\n\r\nI've been tinkering and I haven't come to a solution that I like. To make it externally controlled, you still need to pass back the converted value to the user of the component, so you have a bunch of \"onChangeFunction\" (value, mode, conversion). \r\n\r\nSo my current take is (as Shiv mentioned in his comment too): Have it internally controlled (super easy to use, just a drop-in component / widget). If you want full control, you have the hook!\r\n\r\nBut I might be missing something! \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm gonna add some props (like defaultValue as Rinat suggested) to make it more functional.\r\n\r\nAlso will add the InputBase from Rinat.",

I wasn't sure whether to post the comment here or on https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-ui/issues/22.\r\n\r\nFirst, this is a nice approach, and it solves a lot of use cases.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"837\" height=\"307\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f2bb440-b367-433b-887c-e68160524270\" />\r\n\r\nThis is not beautiful, but it gets the job done haha\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nMy only _concern_ is if we are going too far. As we talked a few weeks ago, we have the components and the hooks. With hooks, you can do whatever you want (jsx / style wise), and components will give you some defaults that work out of the box.\r\n\r\nThis, from Shiv (on #22)...\r\n\r\n> There are 3 problems we need to solve for better DX:\r\n> 1. Allowing people to somehow pass a global object so that they don't need to pass the same color to each component they use\r\n> 2. Handling dark mode nicely\r\n> 3. Specific component color override. (Like they only want AddressInput to look different but EtherInput and other components should look the same)\r\n\r\n... might be going too far. If we implement these, as this PR does, we are basically solving \"everything\". It feels like we are just one step away from not needing the hooks (just JSX/layout tweaks)\r\n\r\n**These are just raw thoughts, opening them for discussion.**\r\n\r\nLet me try to think about a few options from out-of-the-box solutions (less customization) to max customization (this PR)\r\n\r\n1. **Having predefined themes**. It could just be light / dark.... or a 2/3 color palette for each mode.\r\n2. **Root customization with CSS vars**. Same as 1 (just light / dark themes) + allow overriding those with CSS vars (Rainbowkit does this?)\r\n3. **\"Total\" Control**. This PR. I think it's 2 + allow customization per component.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTLDR: This approach definitely solves our needs. Just let's make sure we are not overengineering things.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you all think!! Happy to have a call for this next week, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Or you mean by directly copypasting component code?\r\n\r\nI was talking about headless components / Compound components / etc. Approaches that let you control the layout of the exported component from the lib (the only thing missing from not needing hooks at all)\r\n\r\n> Will @source inline(\"bg-sui-primary ...) will remain constant or we have to keep updating it? (just thinking will it be PITA for us like everytime we update the theme we need to update the sources)\r\n\r\nWe are also increasing the CSS for the user (all the classes will always be present, whether they use it or not). Maybe it's ok if these classes are not going to change a lot and there are just a few of them.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Do we really want to export all the utility classes to the user?? It seems that the users will be using just the CSS tokens to override things, and you said:\r\n\r\n> I think it's not the case since the app could have totally **different colors** and every our palette could be bad\r\n\r\nSo people will use our default colors.... or override them with their own colors (with CSS tokens), so I don't think they will use things `bg-sui-primary` in their code\r\n\r\nSo I'd go with 1 from your options, Rinat.",

We have the `example` in the root, but that's internal....vs \"docs\" which is deployed. Not sure what are the PRO/CONS or the standard, just asking! \r\n",

I was thinking about SE-2, where we have stuff inside `packages` and none of them are published into npm (more like a way to manage a monorepo of \"deployed\" things in general)\r\n\r\nBut all good, I was just wondering. Let's keep it as it is! We can always change.",
