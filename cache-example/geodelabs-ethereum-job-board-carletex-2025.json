(between companies and newsletter)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9618c7a2-54e0-4d60-ba8b-f2a0271ad558)\r\n- Could we add a \"Your featured job post here\" at the top of the list?\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e20fa778-a655-4b29-961d-373f1e381809)\r\n- This is the multisig for the donations: 0xb66879142aE4f8B4C0A11B773942499831367606 (live in multiple networks). Not sure what's the best option to handle this. For now a link to Etherescan / Rainbow could be good (and then we can thing about building somehting ourselves, like a page with a QR / connect wallet / whatever)\r\n- Could you change the style of the \"Donate\" link? Instead of a regular link, a button with some background.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think all of these are small things, but also feel free to leave stuff for the next PR.\r\n\r\nThanks man!\r\n\r\n",
