      "body": "Thanks for the detailed PR :)\r\n\r\nCheck the review comments: there are some issues. Maybe we can also take a different approach with next lint:\r\n\r\n> 1. Should we create a separate .lintstagedrc.json in the root dir?\r\n> 2. Should use next:lint with lint-staged like [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint#lint-staged), I tried finding some solutions with this approach but didn't get any good one, If we want this, I will dig in more deep.\r\n\r\nIf you can make next:lint with lint-staged... I think that would be ideal. It seems to be the most \"integrated\" way of doing it. You might be running into issues because we are in a monorepo? \"Root folder\" might be the \"frontend\" folder.\r\n\r\nI found this example (not monorepo) but it might help you.\r\n\r\nhttps://amanhimself.dev/blog/setup-nextjs-project-with-eslint-prettier-husky-lint-staged/\r\n\r\nHappy to help if you need!",

(Demo attached below)\r\n\r\n> Should we create a New issue for this? or try fixing it in this PR only? Like I tried finding a solution but didn't get anything useful.\r\n\r\nYep, we'll need to find a way to trigger that balance refresh with rainbow kit.

So it's usually once or twice. The idea of introducing polling is to have an up to date price.\r\n\r\nAlso, your approach have a problem: it's waiting 15 seconds to make the first call, and we want that to happen immediately, and then poll every X seconds.

I added a enable/disable flag for the polling.\r\n\r\n**Use asyn/await.**  \r\nAs a convention, we use async/await in the project (VS .then())\r\n\r\n**Return price = 0 on error. Explicit TS type on return functions**\r\nI think it's better if the util always return a number. Now it returns 0 when error (hope this is never the real value of ETH 😂)\r\n\r\n@technophile-04 Can you review & test these changes? ",

Looking great!!\r\n\r\nLeft a few review comments.\r\n\r\nAnswering to your suggestions:\r\n\r\n> I have used daisy UI's [Collapse component](https://daisyui.com/components/collapse/) to show the read and write contract's function. Seems like daisy UI does this by using CSS only because of which in future if we need open/close state then it will be somewhat difficult to get. Please let me know if I should implement the collapsable manually with react state, happy to refactor the code :)\r\neg: Where we might need open/close state is changing the DownArrow icons besides read and write buttons :\r\n\r\nIt seems that Daisy has the `collapse-arrow` class. Could you try that? https://daisyui.com/components/collapse/#with-arrow-icon\r\n\r\nBTW, **Can you make the content visible by default?** https://daisyui.com/components/collapse/#force-open\r\n\r\n> If you look at Address input in the above video it doesn't seem to fit well since we are using the AddressInput component there.\r\n\r\nRn the AddressInput is not used anywhere else. So what if we tweak it as we need... and we can think about generalizing it OR abstract it in the future? let's see how that looks like!\r\n\r\n> While Implementing the design I found repeating the same class names for different div's, is it ok if [extract these classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply) and put them inside globas.css ?\r\n\r\nThis is tricky! I'd say: If it's a group of classes that we are going to use in different component / pages, then @apply sounds good. But if it's for divs in the same component, I don't think it makes sense (for now at least!). We can always refactor later on.\r\n\r\n> Feel free to point out bad coding practices and stuff that can be done better...happy to refactor it again!\r\n\r\nEverything looks clean and minimal ;)\r\n\r\nThanks Shiv!\r\n",

Tooltip always open**\r\n\r\nMaybe I wasn't clean enough on the issues (sorry!), but we wan't the tooltip to show all the time (not only on hover) when we are in localhost & balance is 0. You can use the `tooltip-open` class\r\n\r\n**2. Tooltip position**\r\n> daisyui doesn't support complex tooltips, like bottom-left, only centered bottom or centered left. So I placed the tooltip to the left (only when the balance is 0)\r\n\r\nFor this, you can use the daisy `tooltip-bottom` class and add the needed Tailwind classes to look like we want. I managed to do this adding some tw classes (`before:left-auto before:right-0 before:transform-none before:content-[attr(data-tip)]`)\r\n\r\n![rinat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486142/212922151-c660dfb8-e4ac-494a-9c85-66b1c5ece237.png)\r\n\r\nYou can also make the tooltip tail (the triangle indicator) a bit bigger, overriding the `--tooltip-tail` var. (6px looks good, as in the screenshot)\r\n",

Don't you all think is bad DX? Not sure if there is another option: Maybe `import { Address } from \"abitype\";` as they do in wagmi... and use that type instead of `string`. Not sure of the implications yet, but would love to hear your thoughts! \r\n\r\nThanks!!",

I thought about adding wei/gwei/eth radio buttons near that input, so we'll need decimals here. Not sure it will be easy\r\n\r\nI was just tinkering with Austin and found this issue: Yes, it's wei so no decimals... **but** the way people use that input modifier is by writing something like \"0.25\" and clicking the button to convert it to wei. Also we feel that people don't use the \"#\" operator so we might remove it for now. I'm gonna to create an issue for it.",

Always love your deep researches :) \r\n\r\n> Don't know why for me adding abitype to devDependency of nextjs directory is not working that's why added it directly to monorepo (Even I feel we shouldn't add such thing to monorepos's dependency, would love if someone could give this a try might be some problem with my vsCode)\r\n\r\nFor me (I use Intellij) it works without adding `abitype` as a **devDependency** anywhere (I deleted all the node_modules folders && yarn install). The global.d.ts does the trick for me.\r\n\r\nI created https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/107 to check types. To test, I merged it in this branch (in my machine) and ran `yarn next:check-types`.. and it worked! (Except for your point 3).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486142/214140695-46fe8792-8937-4e56-bdf6-a4f56f86f417.png)\r\n\r\nIf I remove the `global.d.ts` file, it gives me:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486142/214140783-15fea45d-a662-43fa-9a9c-5075bb541c1d.png)\r\n\r\nSo it seems that it works fine with just having the `global.d.ts` declaration. Maybe it's something going on with your IDE?\r\n\r\n> used disable-next-line no-unused-vars for global.d.ts, I think there is some problem with eslint : checkout https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/2287\r\n\r\nNot our fault so not a big deal, let's keep the disabled-next-line there.\r\n\r\n> IMP: if you pull the changes and go to BurnerConnector.ts you will find some typescript errors because in some places AdressType still refers to 0x{string} even after adding the declaration file.\r\n\r\nThis is a weird one :/ \r\n\r\nI'd say: spend a little more time with it if you want.... and if we can't find a solution, lets `// @ts-ignore` it, writing a bit of explanation.\r\n\r\n",

I saw this (didn't check how they implemented it): https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fast-marquee\r\nMaybe we can get some inspiration from it... or even use the lib (Not sure if I can live with the extra 27 Kb haha)\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you don't see a good solution for now..... let's leave it as it's.

Also I think current approach is not minimal of showing error with component so fee free to point it out and will add a simple message asap instead of creating new components raised_hands\r\n\r\nYesss, let's add it to the config.\r\n\r\nLove to see that we share the same mindset.",

I guess Vercel is the top option for NextJS projects. I haven't use their CLI, I always configure the deploy connecting github from the Vercel UI (and then any push to main is deployed automatically).\r\n\r\nI think it's something we could explore!\r\n\r\n@technophile-04 Could you check the differences (specially on DX / simplicity) between Surge CLI vs Vercel CLI? I'll be interested to see the steps you need to take (if you don't have an account on any of them) to deploy: going to the UI? confirm email?\r\n\r\n- If Vercel CLI allows to not having to create an account (in the UI) and you can deploy directly from the CLI the first time you use it... maybe we could consider switching from Surge to Vercel.\r\n- If not, we could offer both options (or just having Surge and telling people about options in the DOCS)\r\n\r\nIn any case, we have this PR that it's working and we can merge any time :) Thanks Shiv!!!\r\n",

Also Vercel support all NextJS capabilities (not like surge). So let's roll with it!\r\n\r\n> if you go to https://test-deploy-iota.vercel.app/debug you see NO contract found and you need to connect your wallet particularly to goerli to see the contract and even interact with it. This issue seems like an beta-launch issue I think the reason might be using of useNetwork and useProvider which depends on connected wallet rpc i might be wrong but looking into this\r\n\r\nYep! I saw you created an issue/PR. I'll comment there. Thanks\r\n\r\n> I think we should keep it true here (NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS)\r\n[se-2/packages/nextjs/.env.production](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/blob/5a715b28e6bf3c82500a03384154f76ef9ced2ed/packages/nextjs/.env.production#L2)\r\n\r\nI changed it for now. I think we should take another approach for this, since the network switcher is not something that most people use (you usually deploy your dApp to work on a single network): hardhat when developing + goerli/mainnet on prod. Maybe instead of NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS we can have a NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NETWORK_SWITCH (defaults fo false). Anyway, I'll think more about this and will create an issue for it.\r\n\r\nI also added some (v0.1) documentation to the README.\r\n",

If `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` is a invalid network, it defaults to hardhat (because of `getTargetNetwork`). I get the same \"Cannot connect to local provider\" which is confusing.

      "body": "While I'm playing with this, some thoughts:\r\n\r\n. It'll take some time to get this right, but let's keep exploring this approach.\r\n- wagmi/cli as @technophile-04 suggested, might be a good solution when everything works :D It's super new, so let's see how it evolves\r\n- _(from my fuzzy brain)_ I still think there should be a way to tweak `useDeployedContractInfo` / or passing a TS generic (with the ABI?) somewhere to get the types for the contract data. Anyway, it's no clear in my head right yet haha. Converting JSON to TS, seems to be needed.\r\n\r\n**The biggest DX issue that we have right now:**\r\n![b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486142/220172561-d4385262-c151-4473-8beb-dbd77f51a03f.png)\r\n![a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486142/220172568-9c775245-f3be-4de3-9e1e-c018df8dc32e.png)\r\n\r\nSince `data` in unknown we get the `ReactNode` error. It won't happen if data is `any`. Can we make that happen as v0.1? Creating an issue for it. https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/issues/189\r\n\r\nIf we fix that, we won't have autocompletions / type inference, but at least you can use data freely.\r\n\r\n> remove generated folder from gitignore, since typings rely on generated/hardhat_contracts file\r\n\r\nThe best solution would be that the generation happens on the build step, i.e. running the hardhat node + deploy on build.\r\n\r\nThanks all! I'll keep iterating on this.",

      "body": "> Why do we need to maintain uncontrolled behavior? For users who will decide to use forms?\r\n\r\nIt started with the `AddressInput` component. Adding the uncontrolled behav was basically adding this line (+ some checks):\r\n```ts\r\n  const currentValue = value !== undefined ? value : address || \"\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nBesides using forms (on regular HTML inputs, you have the option of use them as controlled VS uncontrolled, even if the controlled way is the recommended way)... I liked the idea of adding `<AddressInput />` into the page with no props and you could see the component doing its work (ens resolution, ens avatar, blockie, etc). Maybe a silly thing, but adding it was trivial.\r\n\r\nI though it was a good idea to for the `EtherInput` component too. But it's more complex by nature, and yep, the controlled input was broken (in a weird way) but also working in \"controlled\" & \"uncontrolled\" mode (in a weird way :D)\r\n\r\nI like the component refactor in this PR (way more clean now), but I don't think it's working as I understand it should:\r\n\r\n**Uncontrolled:**\r\n- `<EtherInput />` This doesn't work. It works on main.\r\n\r\n**Controlled**\r\n- `<EtherInput value=\"12\" />`. This shows the correct value of 12 (and its USD value), but it let you change the ETH value on the input (it shouldn't in a controlled component). Same error in main (+ doesn't show the init value). It doesn't make sense to use the component like this tho, but, it tell us that we are not handling the \"controlled\" input the right way.\r\n- `<EtherInput value={amount} onChange={v => setAmount(v)} />`. This works perfectly, better than the exiting main, since it takes in consideration the init value.\r\n\r\n\r\n> upd. It looks like you changed all the inputs behavior to controlled in https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/220 . Probably we're wasting time trying to make it work for uncontrolled\r\n\r\nIt all boils to this. What do you all think? My opinion:\r\n\r\n- Make uncontrolled work if it doesn't take too much effort / complexity. \r\n  - If it does, nix it (I think #220 does it by making onChange mandatory)\r\n- Make the controlled version work as it should. (#220 has the same problem, where you can still change the input on a hardcoded value and not update).\r\n\r\nIn any case, we are not wasting time! :P These tinkering / discussions are good for the project.\r\n\r\nThank you all <3\r\n\r\n",

Can we think about other use case? Since we are in the front-end, 99.99% of the times we'll want to use the connected signer (besides the faucet, and maybe a exotic build where we do deterministic private key derivation or something)\r\n- `getBlockExplorerTxLink` doesn't return anything for the local chain (the only instance where we are using a custom signer for the transactor :thinking: )\r\n- `getLocalProvider` is only used in the Faucet stuff. Could be an unneeded early abstraction.\r\n- Maybe an util like `getChainFromChainId` that returns a wagmi Chain for a given Id?\r\n\r\nIn any case, no need to make any updates rn!! just thinking out loud and pointing out some possible inconsistencies. Maybe we made some past decisions that could use some refactors for the sake of consistency / simplicity / better DX.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

      "body": "> Moved scaffold.config to root and same is being utilised by both next and hardhat\r\n\r\nThis is great! I think having an unique config file it's more dx friendly. A few thoughts/questions: \r\n\r\n- Could/Should we add a single source of truth here about networks? We have the `networks.ts` file on next, and we use the networks also in `hardhat.config.ts`. I'm just wondering if we could define a network object with all the data we need in scaffold.config, for hardhat & next (wagmi) to use. \"Networks\" feel like a key & transversal piece for SE-2 (or any dApp)\r\n- Should we also support env vars in the config file? Specifically for secrets, since people are going to commit the config file. Things like \"DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY\" or even alchemy/infura keys that could live in config.\r\n```ts\r\nconst scaffoldConfig: ScaffoldConfig = {\r\n\ttargetNetwork: chain.hardhat,\r\n\tpollingInterval: 30000,\r\n        deployerdPrivateKey: process.env.DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY\r\n} as const;\r\n```\r\nI think we'll just need the dotenv package on the root. Handling all the config & env vars in the root seems more friendly. I think it will work on Vercel when manually defining the env vars in their UI.\r\n\r\nThis is just me thinking out loud, would love to hear your view on it.\r\n\r\n> btw I came across some patterns where people have created config directory similar to nextjs and harhdat where all the base configurations live like .eslintrc, .tsconfig etc, just wanted to put here since we are in \"refactoring phase\" :) and also we can put scaffold.config inside it. I like the way currently it is now but would love to know others thought\r\n> I'm used to those types of config files being at the root of their package, that's where I would generally look for them, so it doesn't bother me personally.\r\n\r\nSince this is a monorepo with two packages, it also doesn't bother me having separate config files. But I've also seen monorepos with a **shared** (or config) directory.. I guess it's an alternative to having everything shared in the root (when is too bloated). It's definitely something that we should explore, but maybe in the future / another PR? This PR is already a big refactor.",

Vercel root directory\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-16 at 2 40 32 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80153681/225569118-da97971f-96ba-4dbd-b45d-d2a1ccc08fcf.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt might be like a little thing, but for me, it decreases the deploy experience by a bunch. I tried to search for options for the CLI / vercel.json config file, but it doesn't seem that you can provide a default `root directory` option. The `--cwd` option doesn't work either.\r\n\r\nNot sure what we could try.\r\n\r\n### 2. .env vars\r\n\r\n> If we plan to have global env's then implement them, checkout out the last section for resistance faced https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/231#issuecomment-1470438008\r\n\r\nI think we need .env vars for secrets. \r\n\r\n**Answer 1**\r\nRight now on `scaffold.config.ts`:\r\n```ts\r\nconst scaffoldConfig: ScaffoldConfig = {\r\n  // ....\r\n  deployerPrivateKey:\r\n    \"0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80\",\r\n // ..\r\n} as const;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then `const deployerPrivateKey = process.env.DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY ?? scaffoldConfig.deployerPrivateKey;` on `hardhat.config.ts`. It's confusing, since we have the `deployerPrivateKey` on the config file and it's not clear that people need to create a `.env` file inside the hardhat folder\r\n\r\nI think it should be:\r\n```ts\r\nconst scaffoldConfig: ScaffoldConfig = {\r\n  // ....\r\n  deployerPrivateKey: process.env.deployerPrivateKey || \r\n    \"0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80\",\r\n // ..\r\n} as const;\r\n```\r\nSo people can create a `.env` file in the root folder (we might have a `.env.example`) that it's meant for secrets. And secrets consumers just read `scaffoldConfig.deployerPrivateKey`. Same for `alchemyApiKey` and `etherscanApiKey`.\r\n\r\nAnd make sure people understand that they should never use `scaffoldConfig` to store secrets directly (even if we are doing so :sweat_smile:)\r\n\r\nMaybe we could pass the secrets/env vars like this to Vercel:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486142/225676113-6b2d92e7-55d5-4967-ae80-aa3356b655a5.png)\r\n\r\nIf people create/update an env var from the Vercel UI, they will take effect if they rebuild (they are being used on the scaffold.config.file)?\r\n\r\n**Answer 2**\r\n\r\nUse `scaffold.config.ts` only for public variables (targetNetwork && pollingInterval), and handle the secrets env vars in its own package:\r\n- **Hardhat.**. Same as in main (.env file)\r\n- **NextJS**.  We'd replace `.env.*` with the config file, but people could still use `.env` / `.env.local` / Vercel UI to set up secrets and use them in their API routes or whatever.\r\n\r\nThis way we don't mix config & secret env vars... and things might be simpler.\r\n\r\n> Handle this properly https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/231#discussion_r1132625398\r\n\r\nThis is not a big deal for now. We could create an issue for that refactor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDefinitely having a root config file makes things a bit more complicated. I'll be up for it if we find a nice balance. But https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/231#issuecomment-1471517364 is still on my mind.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n",

We solved that using the `satisfies` operator.\r\n\r\nThe issue then is that TS complains when we compare `scaffoldConfig.targetNetwork.id` (resolved to a specific number) with another specific number. \"Types have no overlap\". We need to assert the type (as number) to remove the error.\r\n\r\nI don't love the casting here, seems counterintuitive, since you are working with the wagmi Chain type, but it's not really resolving as such. But I could live with it.\r\n\r\nJust throwing another idea, and see if you all think it's worth implementing it:\r\n\r\nAs we had before https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/246, have a `getTargetNetwork` util than returns the selected network in config:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst getTargetNetwork = (): Chain => { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo benefits I see:\r\n- It solves this error.\r\n- We can directly access the config when we need the specific value (for #202)\r\n- We could extend the targetNetwork value there (e.g. adding the colors)\r\n- It's a wrapper, so if we ever change the way of defining the targetNetwork, we'd just need to change it here (e.g. we move the scaffold.config to the root).\r\n\r\nShiv already mentioned why he decided to remove this extra function in https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2/pull/246#discussion_r1139234630.

      "body": "Thanks @sverps \r\n\r\nFrom #249\r\n\r\n> I think a more intuitive behavior is to disable the hook when we know it would result in an error, and only call the contract function when the params are good. That way, the types force a dev to plug in correctly typed variables for args, and when a user using the UI does some action (i.e. fill in a form) that actually provides a value for the variables, only then is the actual contract function called.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we are only checking if one of the args is undefined, so yes, we avoid a bunch of console errors in the case that a **read Hook has multiple arguments and the builder uses a form** (until the user starts typing in the last argument input).\r\n\r\nIf it only takes 1 args:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst [address, setAddress] = useState(\"\");\r\n\r\nconst { data } = useScaffoldContractRead({\r\n  contractName: \"YourContract\",\r\n  functionName: \"userGreetingCounter\",\r\n  args: [address],\r\n});\r\n\r\nreturn (\r\n  <>\r\n    <AddressInput value={address} onChange={v => setAddress(v)} />\r\n    <p>{data?.toString()}</p>\r\n  </>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, you'd still get all the errors, right? You might save *1* error if you use `useState<string | undefined>();` on load.\r\n\r\n> Reduce contract calls (or at least reduce triggers of the wagmi hook)\r\n\r\nYes, I think the contract is never called (RPC calls not fired) until the args are OK. We just get the errors from Ethers (that wagmi uses under the hood)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe can definitely merge this, but I guess a better solution could be to check if the args are **valid** depending on their type (Address, number, etc)\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

We are using JSON.stringify(dep), but the linter is not capable of inferring it. Using this method might be problematic on big objects / objects with circular references... but in this case, they will be small objects with one/few props.\r\n\r\nMy vote would be to add:\r\n// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Hey all! I've been testing this, and everything seems to be working great. Amazing work @portdeveloper and @technophile-04. This is going to be a great addition.\r\n\r\nI think we need to fix some styling before merging. I promise these will be the latest requests :D Since it's a really big PR, I'm sure we'll find some issues later, but we can handle them in a different PR.\r\n\r\n### 1. Everything is huge\r\n\r\nMost of the buttons, text, tabs, etc are really big compared to other (existing) elements of the page.\r\n\r\nEg: \r\n![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/assets/2486142/215738a1-866b-4a7d-8dd3-be46977db0f5)\r\n![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/assets/2486142/c5b9dfa6-c7c5-4f98-9d92-742ab32ec8ac)\r\n\r\nLet's remove all the `*-lg` stuff. It should be regular sizes (no modifier) and in some cases `*-sm` (buttons, maybe some texts)\r\n\r\n### 2. Light mode\r\n\r\n2.1 There is no background color here, all is floating on the page (dark mode looks great tho):\r\n![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/assets/2486142/7fad23bb-8430-49bc-9a2a-43f58d635579)\r\n\r\n2.2 Not important but the table has no zebra style (maybe we need to tweak something in the tailwind styles?). Also, no need to tackle this here if we don't want to.\r\n![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/assets/2486142/76fe5e89-6cb0-4301-9ad7-02eb357019f3)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n1 and 2.1 are bugging me, but other than that... everything looks great.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to work on this too, if you guys are not sure about some of the stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We can't automatically add every single thing that _could_ be useful on SE-2... we'd end with a massive project. That's why he suggested adding it as an extension in the CLI (#251)\r\n\r\nIn this particular case... I think ZkSyncEra is probably something that will be used and might be worth it to add it to the core.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you all think!",

      "body": "Thanks for the feedback and the help @rin-st.\r\n\r\n> btw I was trying to use npx create-eth@latest from se-2 folder. If I use it from outside git repo it works as expected\r\n\r\nYep, this was happening when running it inside an existing git repo (because of the postinstall yarn hook). Your fix works perfectly, but it leaves the `yarn.lock` file uncommitted (changed after running `yarn install`**), so we decided to take a different approach (git init before yarn install, but add & commit after yarn install) and it seems to work. @technophile-04 will push in a bit.\r\n\r\n** This is expected since we have an empty `yarn.lock` file, to avoid conflicts when we have a bunch of extensions. So it's generated on the first install. In package.json files, we changed ^ for ~, so with packages bugfixes there is less risk of something breaking (we tried to do exact versions in package.json, but for some reason the peer-dependencies weren't installing)\r\n\r\n> On Windows (both my desk and laptop) it's working like a charm when I choose hardhat, but when I choose foundry, I got problems to yarn chain.\r\n\r\nThanks @Pabl0cks ! Yes, this happens because people need to install foundryup (that contains anvil and some other tools) in their **system**. What we are going to do is check if they have it installed and if not show a message hinting them to install.\r\n\r\nWe'll be pushing (& publishing) in a bit.\r\n\r\nThanks all!",

Thanks for this!\r\n\r\nIn SE-1, there are hundreds of branches that people contributed, showcasing a huge variety of use cases for web3 apps that people could use as templates.\r\n\r\nIn SE-2, we didn't embrace the same model, since we don't think branches are meant for that. They are now primarily used for isolating feature development & bug fixing. This helps us maintain a clear and organized development workflow.\r\n\r\nWe don't have a great system for showcasing community builds right now (but it's on the roadmap!**). I think the best you can do is create your build in your BG profile (https://app.buidlguidl.com/) so people can find it in the /builds route. \r\n\r\n** The idea is to improve the current /builds page, with tagging / filter search / etc.\r\n\r\nThanks again!",

It can apply prettier when saving a given file. If not, you are using single quotes, missing spaces, etc.\r\n- You didn't include the updated `yarn.lock`.\r\n- Did you follow the Migration guide from Nexthttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration.? It seems that you didn't update react / react-dom / eslint-config-next. Also there are some things (like migrating next/head[https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration#step-3-migrating-nexthead]) that you didn't include. Not sure if it was on purpose (to make a progressive migration)\r\n\r\n",

It's much more convenient than using components folder. So probably it will be better to move page specific components to _components folders in every page. This is negotiable and doesn't need to be done just now. @carletex @technophile-04 what do you think?\r\n\r\nI like this idea. So we will move blockexplorer / example-ui from the root \"components\" to a \"_components\" folder inside the corresponding route, right? What about the Header / Footer, etc and the `scaffold-eth` component folder? Would we leave it as it is?\r\n\r\nWill also like to know what @technophile-04 thinks!",

Maybe not as convenient as just running `yarn update` on a given dependency... by it's definitely better than having a version mismatch between the local & prod env.

It's a cool solution, but will only solve when deploying from the cli (I guess most people do that? I always do it by connecting the GitHub repo from the Vercel UI). Also, some of the prompts are a bit confusing. I like the default `--prod` tho.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we'd want to solve this issue completely.

      "body": "Hey @technophile-04! Thank you so much for the write-up & context. Now I see everything more clearly. Some of the stuff you mentioned was on my notes (I was planning to post it in the pnpm PR, but will do it here)\r\n\r\nI had a wall of text haha, but since you already did a great job given all the context, let me just comment on it and propose next steps.\r\n\r\n> main issue : \"Version mismatch between the local & prod env\" i.e. https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/issues/419\r\n\r\nExactly. This is the most «critical» issue. We thought that having separate lock files would fix it (which it will!), but It was weird to me that not so many people were using that feature (and is not present in other package managers) & it seemed a bit unstable.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue (you are 100% right, it's not an issue when connecting repo in Vercel UI) in a better way :rocket: \r\n\r\n### CLI\r\n\r\n> Locking versions in package.json makes sense there since we don't have .lock files and up for it 🙌 (We already using ~ their instead of ^)\r\n> Not sure about adding .lock files by default. I mean currently its fine because we just have plain SE-2  next but when add extensions like TheGrpah then we will be needing to add more packages to plain SE-2 next which might not be easy\r\n\r\nAgree with what you said. We can lock versions in package.json (or ~)... and yeah, it can get messy pre-generating `.lock` files (as you said, extensions might add some deps to other extensions). Maybe, if we want to super-optimize, we could generate a couple of global `.lock` files (nextjs + hardhat / nextjs + foundry). It'd improve performance for the most used option (but this is future future haha)\r\n\r\nso...\r\n\r\n### PNPM\r\n\r\nIf I remember correctly the main reason we started thinking about PNPM was **the issue that this PR is fixing**:\r\n\r\n> Also just mentioning pnpm here 😅 (It's workspaces has this option to create separate lock files) ....I tried it out and its really good also we might also benefit from it using it in our CLI due to its some what faster installations\r\n\r\n(Shiv on https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/issues/419#issuecomment-1637115179)\r\n\r\nYes, I get it, pnpm is fancy and faster (especially if we disabled the per-package lock files) but I don't think it's worth it at this point. It has some issues on Windows (the env vars), and IT'S DAMN HARD TO WRITE, READ AND SAY haha \r\n\r\nSo now I change my 51% (pnpm) / 49% (yarn) vote to 1% (pnpm) / 99% (yarn)... and I'd keep an eye on Bun. It could be a nice option to improve performance. BTW, I think yarn gets a lot of shit, but I think v3 is good & fast enough.\r\n\r\nThoughts? \r\n",

      "body": "> Also btw in CLI since we are not adding .lock file we could let people choose the packageManager of their choic (we have yarn patch but we can generate similar patches in the corresponding package manager and ship respective which user chose) lol again this way ahead in future\r\n\r\nThis is a good idea! (and I think people will like it too). It might be tricky a bit tricky for the docs (when running the commands):\r\n\r\n```<your_package_manager> run deploy```\r\n\r\nhaha. Anyway, we can think about this in future iterations\r\n\r\n> I tried it. For now, it's not so good for monorepos, for example you can't use scripts from your workspaces in main package.json. But as I understand they're adding features fast so I'm planning to check how it works from time to time\r\n> Yup yup, I think incase in the future if we plan to change package manage bun might be better options hopefully bun will get more stable by then\r\n\r\nYes, let's keep an eye on it and see how it evolves. We can rethink in a few months. \r\n\r\n> How to write and say it, I don't care. Probably because I don't speak about it 😄 .\r\n\r\n:rofl: yeah, that's a complain I got from Austin (I agree tho), since he makes a bunch on live workshops / videos, etc. But like you said, it's a \"breaking change\".  \r\n\r\n> if not we can close this PR and even https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/pull/444 (feeling sad saying this 🥲 lol no JK 😂)\r\n\r\nhahah. I'm super glad we explored & tinkered with that option. But we realized that it's not optimal for us. So... great work <3\r\n\r\n> So I am leaning towards removing ^ from package.json for now\r\n> Maybe since https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/pull/541 was solved we could wait over this weekend\r\n\r\nLet's regroup next week and see.\r\n\r\nThanks all!!

We could just add it to the `.link:hover` selector... or create a custom class in `tailwind.config.js`. Also, maybe changing the footer link to use the `link` class? (instead of manually setting the underline. I like the offset, so we might want to set the default for the `link` class... or the new custom class.). I know, little things, but it just makes the codebase more consistent!",

I think this is exactly what @rin-st was talking about here: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/pull/541#issuecomment-1734204842\r\n\r\nEven if we install the same top dep (5.0.4) it uses a newer version of `@types/react`. Why? Because package.json file of `@types/react-copy-to-clipboard`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n        \"@types/react\": \"*\"\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n:cry: \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSo not having a lockfile is tricky.\r\n\r\nWe can remove `~`, but things can always break in the future because a new release of sub-dependency updates and breaks something.\r\n\r\nA decent solution:\r\n- Remove `~`\r\n- Have some kind of automated testing that runs every day, installs SE-2 with different options, runs some commands, and checks errors. That way we can identify issues early.\r\n\r\nNot ideal, but better than nothing.\r\n\r\nThoughts? \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAlso check this comment: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/pull/555#discussion_r1345630966\r\n\r\nThis could help for errors related to `@types` packages\r\n\r\n",

Are you saying that we should use wagmi's autoconnect or not? I'd be great if we can do so, but thought that we were encountering some issues.\r\n\r\n> The more I explore the more I feel NextJs app router still feels not prod-ready at least in the context of web 3.0.\r\n\r\nThat's what I thought the first time I tried App routing a few months ago. It got a bit better, but it seems that it's not there yet.\r\n\r\n> Umm just a thought but maybe we should have 2 versions of se-2 pages(main branch) ,app router branch and maybe option two option in CLI, until wagmi2.0 is released (because wagmi seems main backbone of SE-2 and they seem to be not ready yet).\r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity...Maybe we can just wait until wagmi fixs it and take on this PR again? And keep using the page router.... which is working consistently. Open to ideas tho.",

(please feel free to suggest an alternate name)\r\n\r\nWe definitely need to change `generated/` to `contracts/`.  `deployedContracts` I think it covers both: \"external\" contracts + contracts deployed with SE-2. Both are deployed contracts, right? :D\r\n\r\n`index.ts` follows the convention. The only reason I don't like it is because there are a bunch of index.ts files in the project (barrel files most of them)... and it'd be hard to navigate (at least how I do it: CTRL + P, start typing \"deploy...\" and enter). But maybe `contracts/deployedContracts.ts` is too redundant.\r\n\r\nIDK, I'd love to hear what others think too.",

      "body": "> Downside of putting everything in the same file is running yarn deploy seems to overwrite the whole file, and thus it removes any manually added external contracts. So this approach requires changing 99_generateTsAbis.ts to parse the existing file and ensure external contracts are kept. This would require some sort of deep merge, which might not always do exactly what the user expects (e.g. a user that changes a contract name might still see his old contract show up in addition to the newly named one, since our deepMerge would not know if an existing definition is an old deployment, or a user added external contract).\r\n\r\nThis is a great point.\r\n\r\nIf we can figure out the Types for the 2-files approach, it's definitely the way to go (`deployedContracts.ts` & `externalContracts.ts`). \r\n\r\nThanks @technophile-04 & @sverps !!",

Multi-chain projects that use different contract names and functions on each chain are probably advanced enough that devs working on that will understand how to use wagmi directly, I suppose.\r\n\r\nUnless there was a simple solution (which it seems there is not)... I agree with this!\r\n\r\n> (In trying out this idea, I did find a small issue with how the scaffold config file type was defined, not sure why it didn't pop up earlier.)\r\n\r\nWhat is the issue? :nerd_face: \r\n\r\n",

Lets maybe work for @Pabl0cks to test, I will also try to debug till then 🙌\r\n\r\nYep, it works for me as it's.\r\n\r\nAN alternative could be to skip the redirection and just print out on stdout... and people can redirect themselves.",

When using multiple instance, we have the issue that Rinat was mentioning (is loading / data), but It's not terrible and can be worked out.\r\n\r\n**2.** v1 approach: I like this too. The good thing is that the API doesn't change... but it can get confusing with wagmi.\r\n\r\n**3.** Having 2 hooks for writing to a contract. This is the only option that I don't like. I think it'll just make things more confusing.\r\n\r\nWe can ofc merge one of the options.... and adapt if we people don't like it.",

From what I've seen, people create a _single_ frame for an app (typically more complex than what we are doing here). Abstracting \"framRelativeRoute\" + \"frameBtnLabel\"  seems a bit too much.\r\n\r\nIf they want to build a real frame, they'll need to create a backend route with the dynamic steps, so these abstractions won't serve much.\r\n\r\nMy initial idea was to make a simple/silly \"frame\" so people could see it out of the box, and tweak as needed.

Use relative imports (not anymore if we merge this PR!)\r\n\r\nIf so, this is definitely a good step forward, but the process will still be manual (I usually delete the folder, lol).

And all for the discussion.\r\n\r\nI think having this makes sense, since [wagmi removed](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/migrate-from-v1-to-v2#removed-watch-property) the watch prop in most hooks. In #700 we abstracted for builders in our hooks so they can still use `watch`. But not with the `useBalance` one, so this PR makes sense.\r\n\r\nRegarding the name, I don't have a strong opinion, but If I had to vote, I'd say:\r\n\r\n:1st_place_medal:   `useWatchBalance` (or `useBalanceWatch` `useWatchedBalance`). This will make a lot of sense if we remove the `watch` argument as Damu said (if you don't want to `watch` you can use wagmi's `useBalance` directly)\r\n\r\n:2nd_place_medal:  But I also like the current name `useAccountBalance` or `useScaffoldBalance` (consistent with other hooks names) if we want to keep the watch prop.\r\n\r\nAnything works in my mind tho!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Looks like it's redundant\r\n\r\nThe USD mode only makes sense when we have a price for the native currency. If it's loading (or if the fetch fails) it doesn't make sense to show the USD mode... since you won't be able to convert to the native currency (which is what we want for any onchain operation / show balance, etc). So I think that was the reason.\r\n\r\n> Rename usdMode to defaultUsdMode and use that value as default in useState. Remove useEffect. (I prefer this)\r\n\r\nThis will only work if we ignore my previous comment (the price condition). I agree that `defaultUsdMode` might be a better name.\r\n\r\n> Remove inner usd/eth logic. Use only usdMode prop (or mode)\r\n\r\nI don't like this one since it'd require people to do their logic for the basic toggle USD / ETH.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if these components need a refactor, but like you said, it should probably happen in another PR.\r\n\r\nI just created this one as a hotfix, to tackle a bug that is currently happening on main (and tried to be consistent with other components)\r\n",

      "body": "Hey all! \r\n\r\nI spend the morning with Pablo & Shiv (live in Spain!) tinkering with this.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion: non-deterministic things sucks :D\r\n\r\nWe tested 3 versions of the rules files (aso Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7. 3.7 was usually better):\r\n\r\n1. Port's version (you can rollback to this commit to test https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/pull/966/commits/6033ca669cbc5cc1b2ee21569a03dfba99d6c064)\r\n\r\n- This was fast, and got the hooks right (sometimes not in the first try, but it auto-fixed)\r\n- Besides the read/write hooks, it didn't use the \"scaffold-way\" most of the times: Address component, yarn start (was doing yarn dev inside nextjs folder), etc.\r\n\r\n2. Full LLM file pasted into the rules: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/llms-full.txt\r\n\r\n- This was a slower and results similar to Port's (but was slightly better on the scaffold-way)\r\n\r\n3. The current version of this PR: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/pull/966/commits/a20fb77f8f29db55b6efcae121a64847749db293\r\n\r\nWe came to this version after a few tries and I think it has the best of both. Fast & scaffold-aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have to say that most of the tries one-shotted (even if it had to auto correct some times)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis is what we did for testing:\r\n\r\n- We start with cursor with a clean SE-2 install (no chain running, etc)\r\n- First prompt:\r\n```\r\nI want to modify the exiting smart contract and add a delegate feature.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the contract will be able to set a delegate. And the the delegate will be able to witdraw from the contract (as the owner)\r\n\r\nThen I want to create a custom UI (in the homepage) where the current delegate is display, and a input + button the update the delegate with a new Delegate Address.\r\n```\r\n\r\n(this should create a working version and should run chain / deploy /start)\r\n\r\n- When is worklng, second prompt:`\r\n```\r\nCan you change the Owner to be \"<WHATEVER_BURNER_ADDRESS>\"?\r\n```\r\n\r\n(this should modify the script + run yarn deploy again)\r\n\r\n- Last prompt:\r\n```\r\nHow could I deploy this to Sepolia? Don't do it, just tell me the steps to follow.\r\n```\r\n\r\n(beside the basics, it should mention vercel and ipfs and hint to modify scaffold-config with the network).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nLet's do a round of testing and see if we are happy with the results! Thanks all for working on this <3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I think it's good to discuss and have a consensus before moving forward\r\n\r\n> What do you think about that approach at all? Is it fit for us? Maybe some other ideas?\r\n\r\nI like the approach, and I think this could make a lot of sense. I agree with the PROS / CONS. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSomething that we could discuss: where should we draw the line between just tailwind classes & components.\r\n\r\n=> It's clear to me that modals (and similar) should be a Component (because they have some custom styling + \"JS\" functionality). \r\n\r\n=>  On the other side, it's not that clear for things like buttons, since it's _only_ styling. I guess the alternative would be to create some extra utility classes (using `@apply`?) like btn-primary, btn-sm, etc. This applies to things like badges, links, (tooltips?), etc.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there would be a nice dynamic way to create variations with themes/colors/sizes for all of these utility classes.\r\n\r\nPushing back on myself: if we are expecting people to use either raw TW or Shadcn, maybe the approach of having `button`, etc as components is not a bad idea.\r\n\r\nBut yes, for me, not relying on custom components for simpler things seems better. I feel that it makes SE-2 less opinionated and closer to HTML / CSS. People can always create their own components (custom, shadcn, etc)\r\n\r\nAnyway, just opening the discussion! Let me know what you all think!\r\n\r\nThanks again!!!",

To deploy a module, you must export it using module.exports = or export default. As a best practice, we suggest maintaining one module per file, naming the file after the module ID.\n```\n\nBut I couldn't make it work (creating more modules in the file + exporting both)\n\n---\n\nNote: they also have https://hardhat.org/ignition/docs/guides/scripts, where you can do more \"complex\" logic (e.g. console.logs of contract read data)\n\n",
